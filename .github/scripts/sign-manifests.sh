# Sign one or more CDN root manifests (latest.json / releases.json) with the
# release minisign key and verify each signature against the public key the
# daemon EMBEDS, so a manifest can never ship a signature the shipped binary
# cannot check. The daemon verifies latest.json against
# `orcker_update::UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY` before trusting it (see
# `self_update::fetch_releases`), the same key that signs the release artifacts.
#
# Usage: sign-manifests.sh <file> [<file> ...]
#   Writes <file>.minisig next to each input.
#
# Requires: MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY (an *unencrypted* key, as the release job uses,
# to avoid a CI password prompt) and GITHUB_WORKSPACE (to read the embedded
# public key from the source tree). RUNNER_TEMP is used for the transient key
# file when set, falling back to a mktemp dir otherwise.
