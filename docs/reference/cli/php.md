# PHP

Orcker downloads prebuilt static PHP builds and runs an FPM pool per installed version. The [PHP Versions guide](../../guide/php-versions) covers this in depth.

## Choosing the version

The `use` command is overloaded by argument count:

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orcker use <VERSION>` | Set the **global** default: the terminal `php` shim and the per-site fallback. | `orcker use 8.5` |
| `orcker use <SITE> <VERSION>` | Set the PHP version for a single named site. | `orcker use blog 8.3` |

```sh
orcker use 8.5          # global default for the `php` shim and new sites
orcker use blog 8.3     # pin one site to 8.3
```

After a successful global `orcker use <version>` (human output only), `orcker` prints a hint telling you which directory holds the managed `php` shim and warns if a different `php` is found earlier on your `PATH` and would shadow it.

::: warning `orcker use` refuses a legacy version as the default
`orcker use <VERSION>` is refused for an out-of-support [legacy version](../../guide/php-versions#legacy-php-versions)
(7.4 / 8.0 / 8.1) - legacy versions can't be the global default. `orcker use <SITE> <VERSION>`
still accepts one, pinning it to that site only.

## Managing installed versions

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orcker install php <VERSION> [--legacy]` | Install a PHP version (downloads a prebuilt static build). | `orcker install php 8.5` |
| `orcker uninstall php <VERSION>` | Uninstall a PHP version (removes its files; blocked if in use). | `orcker uninstall php 8.3` |
| `orcker update php [VERSION]` | Update a PHP version to the latest release. Omit the version to update every installed version. | `orcker update php` |
| `orcker restart php [VERSION]` | Restart a PHP FPM pool. Omit the version to restart every running pool. | `orcker restart php 8.5` |
| `orcker list php [--check] [--available]` | List installed PHP versions and the global default. | `orcker list php` |

```sh
orcker install php 8.5      # download + run an 8.5 FPM pool
orcker update php           # update all installed versions to latest
orcker update php 8.5       # update just 8.5
orcker restart php          # restart every running pool
orcker uninstall php 8.3    # remove 8.3 (refused if a site still uses it)
```

### The `--legacy` flag

`7.4`, `8.0`, and `8.1` are out-of-support [legacy versions](../../guide/php-versions#legacy-php-versions)
served from a separate manifest. Installing one requires the explicit `--legacy` flag:

```sh
orcker install php 7.4 --legacy
```

Without `--legacy`, `orcker install php 7.4` prints an out-of-support warning and
refuses to install. `--legacy` is a no-op (accepted but unnecessary) for a
supported version.

### `orcker list php` flags

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--check` | Poll the distribution now to refresh "update available" status. Without it, status is served from the daemon's cache (no network). |
| `--available` | List the versions installable from the distribution instead, tagging ones already installed. **Takes precedence over `--check`.** |

```sh
orcker list php                 # installed versions, from cache (no network)
orcker list php --check         # installed versions, freshly checking for updates
orcker list php --available     # everything installable, tagging what you have
```

Installed versions are printed one per line; the current default is marked `(default)`, and any version with a newer release shows `update available: <installed> -> <latest>`. Each installed version then gets a `PHP <version>:` section listing its per-version overrides, custom ini directives, and its [FPM pool size](#fpm-pool-size) - the pool line always prints, showing `(default)` for a version you have not changed. If nothing is installed, `orcker list php` suggests `orcker install php <default>`.

`orcker list php --available` also prints a trailing **Legacy (out of support - no
coverage, no dumps, cannot be default)** section listing the installable
[legacy versions](../../guide/php-versions#legacy-php-versions), tagging any
already installed - the section is omitted when there are none.

## Global PHP ini settings

`set` and `unset` manage global PHP ini defaults that are applied to **every** installed version. `set` writes a value; `unset` resets a setting back to PHP's built-in default (the wire convention is an empty value).

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orcker set php <SETTING> <VALUE> [--only <VERSION>]` | Set a PHP ini default. With `--only`, only that installed version is affected (a per-version override). | `orcker set php memory_limit 512M` |
| `orcker unset php <SETTING> [--only <VERSION>]` | Reset a setting to PHP's built-in value. With `--only`, only that version's override is removed (the global default applies again). | `orcker unset php memory_limit` |

```sh
orcker set php memory_limit 512M
orcker set php display_errors On
orcker unset php memory_limit
orcker set php memory_limit 1G --only 8.3    # only PHP 8.3 gets 1G
orcker unset php memory_limit --only 8.3     # 8.3 inherits the global value again
```

**Precedence:** a version's effective value is its `--only` override when set, else
the global value, else PHP's built-in default. Changing a per-version value
restarts **only** that version's pool; a global change restarts every running
pool. Per-version values survive uninstalling and reinstalling the version.

The setting name (and, for `set`, the value) is validated client-side before connecting, so a typo or an out-of-shape value is a clean usage error rather than a round-trip. The supported settings are:

| Setting | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| `memory_limit` | byte size (e.g. `512M`), or `-1` for unlimited |
| `max_execution_time` | integer |
| `max_input_time` | integer |
| `max_file_uploads` | integer |
| `upload_max_filesize` | byte size (e.g. `64M`) |
| `post_max_size` | byte size (e.g. `64M`) |
| `display_errors` | boolean flag (e.g. `On` / `Off`) |
| `error_reporting` | an `error_reporting` expression |

::: tip
The configured settings are echoed back by `orcker list php` under a `settings:` block, and each version's overrides, directives, and pool size follow in a `PHP <version>:` section, so you can confirm what's currently applied. See the [Configuration Reference](../configuration) for how these are stored and rendered into FPM config.

## Custom extensions

`orcker php ext` registers extra PHP extensions (`.so`) that Orcker's builds don't
ship. A registered extension loads into **both** the FPM (web) runtime and the CLI
for its version. Native extensions are ABI-bound to a PHP minor, so each is
registered under one version.

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orcker php ext add <VERSION> <PATH> [--zend] [--name <NAME>]` | Register an extension for a version. | `orcker php ext add 8.5 /opt/php/pecl/scrypt.so` |
| `orcker php ext remove <VERSION> <NAME>` | Remove a registered extension by name. | `orcker php ext remove 8.5 scrypt` |
| `orcker php ext list` | List registered extensions, grouped by version. | `orcker php ext list` |

```sh
orcker php ext add 8.5 /opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20250925/scrypt.so
orcker php ext add 8.5 /opt/php/xdebug.so --zend --name xdebug
orcker php ext list
orcker php ext remove 8.5 scrypt
```

- `VERSION` is a `major.minor` (e.g. `8.5`) and must be installed.
- `PATH` must be an absolute path ending in `.so`, with no control characters,
  NUL, `"`, or `$` (spaces are allowed). It is validated client-side before
  connecting, so a bad path is a clean usage error rather than a round-trip.
- `--zend` loads it as a `zend_extension` (xdebug/opcache-style) rather than a
  plain `extension`.
- `--name` sets the removal/display handle; it defaults to the `.so` basename.

On `add`, the daemon **load-probes** the `.so` against that version's PHP and
rejects it if it can't load (wrong-version build, missing dependency, or a Zend
extension registered without `--zend`), so a bad extension is a clear error rather
than a broken pool. `add`/`remove` restart that version's running FPM pool.
`orcker php ext list` tags any extension whose `.so` is missing on disk with
`(missing!)`. See the [Configuration Reference](../configuration#php) for how the
registry is stored.

## Custom ini directives

`orcker php ini` sets free-form ini directives for **one** installed version - the
directives Orcker's typed allowlist doesn't cover, typically extension settings
like `xdebug.mode` or `opcache.jit_buffer_size`. They apply to that version's
FPM (web) pool and its CLI.

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orcker php ini set <VERSION> <NAME> <VALUE>` | Set a directive for one installed version. | `orcker php ini set 8.3 xdebug.mode debug` |
| `orcker php ini unset <VERSION> <NAME>` | Remove a directive. | `orcker php ini unset 8.3 xdebug.mode` |
| `orcker php ini list` | List per-version overrides, directives, and pool sizes (same output as `orcker list php`). | `orcker php ini list` |

```sh
orcker php ext add 8.3 /opt/php/xdebug.so --zend   # 1. load the extension
orcker php ini set 8.3 xdebug.mode debug           # 2. configure it
orcker php ini list
orcker php ini unset 8.3 xdebug.mode
```

Names and values are **shape-validated** (no control characters or the ini
metacharacters `[ ] = ; #`), but not semantically: a well-formed directive PHP
doesn't recognise is simply ignored by PHP. Directives Orcker manages through
typed paths are refused with a pointer to the right command: the eight
[allowlisted settings](#global-php-ini-settings) (use `orcker set php`,
optionally with `--only`), `extension`/`zend_extension` (use `orcker php ext`),
and `openssl.cafile`/`curl.cainfo` (Orcker manages the CA bundle).

In the FPM pool config a directive renders as `php_value[name] = value`
(FPM coerces boolean-valued directives); in the version's CLI ini it renders as
a plain `name = value` line. Setting or removing a directive restarts only that
version's pool, and directives survive uninstalling and reinstalling the
version.

FPM's own pool-block settings (anything starting with `pm.`) are **not** ini
directives and are refused here with a pointer at
[`orcker php pool`](#fpm-pool-size).

## FPM pool size

`orcker php pool` sets how many PHP workers one installed version may run at
once. This is FPM's `pm.max_children`, and it applies to that version's web
(FPM) pool only - never its CLI.

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orcker php pool set <VERSION> max_children <N>` | Set the worker ceiling for one installed version. | `orcker php pool set 8.4 max_children 32` |
| `orcker php pool unset <VERSION> max_children` | Reset the ceiling to the default of 16. | `orcker php pool unset 8.4 max_children` |
| `orcker php pool list` | List per-version overrides, directives, and pool sizes (same output as `orcker list php`). | `orcker php pool list` |

```sh
orcker php pool set 8.4 max_children 32
orcker php pool list
#   pm.max_children = 32  (overrides default 16)
orcker php pool unset 8.4 max_children
```

The default is **16** and the accepted range is **1 to 1024**. Orcker runs each
pool in FPM's `ondemand` mode, so workers are spawned as requests arrive rather
than preallocated: raising the ceiling costs nothing while the pool is idle.
Raise it when requests start queueing behind long-running work - queue workers,
parallel test runs, or many open browser tabs against the same site.

Setting or resetting the ceiling restarts only that version's pool, and the
value survives uninstalling and reinstalling the version. In the desktop app
the same control lives in the **Per-version configuration** card, under **FPM
pool size**.
