# LAN sharing <Badge type="warning" text="Beta" />

::: info Beta feature
LAN sharing is new and still settling. If you hit a problem, please
[report it on GitHub](https://github.com/forjedio/orcker/issues/new) - include your
OS, `orcker lan status` output, and what you expected.
:::

By default Orcker serves your `.test` sites only to the machine they run on -
every listener binds `127.0.0.1`. `orcker lan` opts into exposing them to **other
devices on your local network** (a phone, a tablet, another laptop) over the same
ports 80/443, and `orcker remote-setup` provisions a device so it trusts Orcker's CA
and resolves `.test`.

::: warning This exposes your dev sites to the network
LAN sharing binds the web proxy and DNS responder to `0.0.0.0`, so anything that
can route to your machine can reach your sites (subject to the peer filter and
your host firewall). It is opt-in and off by default. Turn it off with
`orcker lan disable` when you're done. Don't enable it on an untrusted network.
:::

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `orcker lan enable` | Expose `.test` sites to the LAN, then restart the daemon to re-bind. |
| `orcker lan disable` | Return to loopback-only, then restart the daemon. |
| `orcker lan status` | Show configured-vs-effective state, the LAN IP, and the next step. |
| `orcker remote-setup` | Mint a one-time command to provision another device. |

## How it works

- **The web proxy and DNS responder bind `0.0.0.0`** while LAN mode is on. A
  peer filter drops any connection whose source address isn't private
  (RFC 1918 / link-local / loopback) - a blast-radius reducer, **not**
  authentication, so a host firewall is still recommended.
- **DNS answers split-horizon.** Your own machine keeps resolving `.test` to
  `127.0.0.1`; other LAN devices get your machine's LAN IP. IPv6 (`AAAA`) is not
  served in LAN mode.
- **Databases, mail capture, dumps, and the IPC socket stay loopback-only.** Only
  the web + DNS + the bootstrap endpoint leave loopback.
- Enabling or disabling **restarts the daemon** (a listen socket's bind address
  is fixed when it's opened), so the change is enforced, not merely saved.

## Privileged setup for ports 80/443

LAN devices expect the well-known ports. Binding them needs a one-time,
per-machine privileged step - the same mechanism as ordinary Orcker use:

- **macOS:** run `sudo orcker elevate ports` (if you haven't already) **and**
  `sudo orcker elevate lan`. The first installs the loopback redirect for on-host
  access; the second installs a `pf` redirect that carries inbound LAN 80/443 to
  Orcker on your LAN IP. Remove the LAN rule later with `sudo orcker unelevate lan`.
- **Linux:** run `sudo orcker elevate ports` once (it grants
  `cap_net_bind_service`, which covers the `0.0.0.0` bind). No separate LAN step.

`orcker lan status` tells you whether these are in place.

## Firewall

Orcker does not configure your firewall. Allow these from your LAN subnet only:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 80, 443 | TCP | web proxy |
| 1053 | UDP + TCP | `.test` DNS responder (or your configured `dns_port`) |
| 7073 | TCP | remote-setup bootstrap (or your configured `lan_setup_port`) |

Example (`ufw`, replace the subnet):

```sh
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 80,443,7073 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 1053
```

::: info IPv6
Orcker binds only IPv4 (`0.0.0.0`) listeners, so there is nothing to reach over
IPv6 today. Note only that IPv4 firewall rules don't cover IPv6 in general.
:::

## Provisioning a device — `orcker remote-setup`

A remote device needs two things to use your `.test` sites: it must **trust
Orcker's CA** (for HTTPS) and **resolve `.test`** to your machine. `orcker
remote-setup` prints a command that does both. It only works while LAN mode is
up.

```sh
$ orcker remote-setup
Run this on the OTHER device (needs sudo, curl, and openssl):

  curl -fsS --retry 3 -o orcker-setup.sh 'http://192.168.1.42:7073/remote-setup?code=…' && [ "$(openssl dgst -sha256 -r orcker-setup.sh | cut -d' ' -f1)" = "<sha256>" ] && sudo bash orcker-setup.sh
```

It is a single line: download the self-contained installer, check its SHA-256
matches, then run it. The installer embeds Orcker's CA, so there is nothing else to
fetch.

::: danger The hash is the trust anchor - verify it
The installer is served over plain HTTP, so its integrity comes entirely from the
**SHA-256 printed on your screen**. The pasted command checks the download
against that hash and, on any mismatch, the `&&` chain stops before `sudo` runs.
The hash travels by your eyes, not the wire - that's what makes this safe. Do not
edit it out. The code is single-use and expires in 15 minutes.
:::

Supported devices: **macOS** and **Linux with dnsmasq or NetworkManager**. A
Linux box using **systemd-resolved alone** is not supported (it can't forward a
single domain to a custom port) - install dnsmasq or use NetworkManager. On
Linux the CA is installed into whichever trust anchor directory the distro
provides (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Fedora or Arch) **and** into the desktop user's NSS
databases, so Firefox, Chromium and Brave trust it too (best-effort, when
`certutil` from `nss` / `libnss3-tools` is present).

**Windows devices are not supported.** Windows has no built-in way to forward a
single domain to a nameserver on a non-standard port - its NRPT rules
(`Add-DnsClientNrptRule`) take a server address but no port, and the `hosts`
file can't express a wildcard. Pointing a Windows box at Orcker needs a local DNS
proxy (such as Acrylic) configured by hand, so there is no bootstrap script for
it.

### Undoing it on a device

Orcker can't revert a device it doesn't control. On each provisioned device, run
the installer's uninstall mode to remove the CA (system store and browser NSS
databases) and the resolver entry:

```sh
sudo bash orcker-setup.sh uninstall
```

## Headless / always-on hosts

If you share from a machine you don't stay logged into, enable a persistent user
session so `orckerd` keeps running (Linux):

```sh
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(whoami)"
```

See the [daemon guide](./daemon) for details.

## Turning it off

```sh
orcker lan disable
```

This restarts the daemon back onto loopback. On macOS the `pf` LAN redirect is
separate privileged state - `orcker lan status` flags it as residual until you run
`sudo orcker unelevate lan`. A full `orcker uninstall` removes it too.
