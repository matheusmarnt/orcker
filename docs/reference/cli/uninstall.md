# Uninstall

`uninstall` has two shapes: remove a single **component**, or remove **orcker itself**.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `orcker uninstall php <VERSION>` | Uninstall a PHP version (removes its files; blocked if a site uses it). See [PHP](./php). |
| `orcker uninstall tool <ID>` | Uninstall a dev tool (`composer`, `node`, `bun`). See [Tooling](./tooling). |
| `orcker uninstall` | **Full uninstall** - remove orcker entirely from this machine. |
| `orcker uninstall --yes`, `-y` | Full uninstall without the confirmation prompt (for scripts / the desktop app). |

The component forms (`php` / `tool`) are daemon-mediated and documented on their own pages. The rest of this page covers the **bare `orcker uninstall`** - the full self-uninstall.

## Full uninstall

`orcker uninstall` with no subcommand removes everything orcker put on the machine. It is **local** (it doesn't go through the daemon - it stops the daemon as part of the teardown) and it **prompts for confirmation** before touching anything.

```sh
sudo orcker uninstall          # recommended: also reverts the elevate system changes
orcker uninstall               # without root: removes everything except the elevate changes
orcker uninstall --yes         # skip the prompt (non-interactive)
```

It removes, in order:

1. **System changes from [`elevate`](./elevation)** - the CA in the system trust store, the DNS resolver entry, and (macOS) the `pf` port redirect. **Root only** - see [Run it with `sudo`](#run-it-with-sudo).
2. **The daemon** - stops and disables the per-user service (systemd `--user` / launchd) and reaps the running `orckerd` (which in turn stops its PHP-FPM pools and any managed services).
3. **The PATH entry** - removes the orcker block from your shell startup files (the same block [`orcker path`](./tooling) manages).
4. **Config, data, and cache** - the `orcker.toml` config, installed PHP versions, dev tools, downloads, the local CA, and the runtime socket directory.
5. **The binaries** - `orcker`, `orckerd`, and `orcker-helper`. A package install is left for your package manager instead (`sudo apt purge orcker` on Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo pacman -R orcker` on Arch, `sudo dnf remove orcker` on Fedora) - orcker never `rm`s package-managed files.

When something can't be removed automatically, it's listed at the end as a leftover to handle manually.

## Run it with `sudo`

The `elevate` changes (trust store, resolver, ports) need root to reverse - and they **can't be reversed after orcker is uninstalled**, because the `orcker-helper` binary is gone. So:

- **`sudo orcker uninstall`** reverts those system changes, then removes everything else (resolved for your real user, even under `sudo`).
- **`orcker uninstall`** (no root) prints a clear warning, lists the exact manual commands to undo the system changes later, and then removes everything else.

::: tip Undo elevation first, or just use sudo
If you started without root, the simplest path is to run `sudo orcker uninstall` so the trust/resolver/port changes are cleaned up automatically. Otherwise follow the printed manual steps (they include your TLD and the CA fingerprint so the leftover CA stays identifiable). See [Elevation & Privileges](../../guide/elevation).
:::

## Confirmation & non-interactive use

You'll be asked to confirm before anything is removed. Pass `--yes` (`-y`) to skip the prompt in scripts. With no TTY and no `--yes`, the command refuses rather than destroying anything silently.

## Platform support

Full uninstall is supported on **macOS** and **Linux**. The desktop app itself (the `.app` / `.deb` / `.pkg.tar.zst` / `.rpm`) is removed the usual way for your platform - drag to Trash on macOS, or `sudo apt purge orcker` (Debian/Ubuntu) / `sudo pacman -R orcker` (Arch) / `sudo dnf remove orcker` (Fedora) on Linux.
