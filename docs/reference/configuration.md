# Configuration Reference

Orcker stores all of its persistent state in a single TOML file: `orcker.toml`. This page documents where that file lives, every field in the schema, the defaults, how schema versioning and migration work, and how saves stay safe. Everything here is grounded in the [`orcker-config`](../developer/crates/orcker-config) crate.

::: tip You rarely edit this by hand
The daemon (`orckerd`) owns `orcker.toml`. Day to day you change it through the [CLI](./cli/) or the [desktop app](../guide/desktop-app), and the daemon rewrites the file atomically. Hand-editing works too - Orcker parses and re-validates the file on every load - but the CLI is the safer path.
:::

## Where the config file lives

The file is always named `orcker.toml` and sits in your per-OS, user-owned config directory:

| OS    | Config directory                          | Full path                                              |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/io.orcker.Orcker` | `~/Library/Application Support/io.orcker.Orcker/orcker.toml` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/orcker` (default `~/.config/orcker`) | `~/.config/orcker/orcker.toml`                       |

These paths come from [`orcker-platform`](../developer/crates/orcker-platform)'s directory resolver, which uses the `directories` crate with the qualifier `io` / `orcker` / `Orcker`. The directory is created on demand the first time the daemon saves; it is not guaranteed to exist before then.

The daemon resolves the path once at startup and falls back to `<config dir>/orcker.toml` unless an explicit path was passed on the `orckerd serve` command line. If the file is absent, the daemon starts from the built-in defaults and writes the file on the first change.

::: info Config vs. data vs. runtime
`orcker.toml` is the only file in the *config* directory. Certificates live in the *data* directory, logs in the *cache* directory, and the IPC socket in the *runtime* directory. See [Architecture](../developer/architecture) and [The Daemon](../guide/daemon) for the full layout.

## Top-level schema

Every field below maps one-to-one to a field in `schema.rs`. The on-disk shape always begins with the `version` line, followed by the scalar keys, then the sub-tables.

| Key         | TOML type            | Meaning                                                            | Default        |

| `groups`    | table                | User-defined site groups and per-site membership.                 | empty          |
| `domains`   | table                | Per-site and per-proxy domain sets (primary, aliases, subdomains, wildcards). | empty |

| `route_rules` | table              | Per-site path-prefix routing rules (prefix → a file inside the site). | empty       |

::: warning Unknown keys are rejected
The parser uses `deny_unknown_fields` at every level. A typo'd or stray key (top-level, or inside `[ports]`, `[php]`, `[parked]`, `[mail]`, `[dumps]`, `[dumps.features]`, `[domains]`, a `[domains.linked.<name>]` / `[domains.parked."<docroot>"]` / `[domains.proxy.<name>]` entry, `[proxy_rules]`, `[route_rules]`, a `[[proxies]]` entry, a `[services.<id>]` table, a `[[linked]]` entry, an `[[overrides]]` entry, or a `[[php.extensions.<version>]]` entry) is a hard parse error - the daemon will refuse to load the file rather than silently ignore it.

The free-form maps are the exception, because their keys *are* the data. `[services.<id>.overrides]` (like `[php.directives."<version>"]`) takes arbitrary directive names, so `deny_unknown_fields` does not apply *inside* it - the keys are shape-checked instead, and a bad one is dropped rather than failing the load. It still applies to the enclosing `[services.<id>]` table.
:::

### `version`

The schema version. This key is **required** - a missing `version` is a hard error (`MissingVersion`), and a non-integer or negative value is rejected (`NonIntegerVersion`). The current schema version is `23`, and Orcker always writes `version = 23`. Older `version = 1` through `version = 22` files are migrated forward automatically on load. See [Schema versioning](#schema-versioning-and-migration) below.

### `tld`

The top-level domain Orcker's resolver answers for, without a leading dot. The default is `test`, giving you `myapp.test`. The value is validated by `orcker-core`: whitespace is rejected, and a trailing dot is silently stripped (`"test."` becomes `"test"`). See [DNS & .test Domains](../guide/dns).

### `dns_port`

The loopback UDP/TCP port the embedded `.test` DNS responder binds to. The default is `1053`. A fixed (non-ephemeral) port keeps the resolver configuration installed by `orcker elevate resolver` valid across daemon restarts. A value of `0` means "ephemeral" and is intended for development and tests only - it is not durable across restarts.

::: tip Port already in use?
If another process holds `dns_port`, the daemon fails to bind and tells you to change `dns_port` in `orcker.toml` or free the port.
:::

### `symlink_protection`

By default (`true`) the proxy refuses to serve a static asset - or resolve a script - reached through a symlink whose target resolves **outside** the requested site's own document root, answering with an explicit `403`. This is a safety guard: a symlink inside a site could otherwise point the server at arbitrary files elsewhere on the host.

Set it to `false` to allow those symlinks. The motivating case is a shared parent/child WordPress theme kept in its own directory beside your sites and symlinked into `wp-content/themes/`: with protection on, its assets 403; with protection off, they are served. The setting is global (all sites) and can be toggled from the desktop app under **Settings › Security**; the change takes effect immediately, without restarting the daemon.

::: warning Off trusts every in-tree symlink
While off, a symlink is followed wherever it resolves, not only within the parked folder. Combined with a public tunnel (`orcker-tunnel`), that can expose files beyond a site's root. Leave it on unless you specifically need a cross-directory symlink like the shared-theme layout above.
:::

### `mcp_enabled`

Whether `orcker mcp` serves Orcker's tools to local AI agents over the Model Context Protocol. Defaults to `false`: exposing Orcker to agents is an explicit opt-in, toggled from the desktop app under **Settings › General › AI Agents**.

The daemon runs no MCP server of its own - it stores this flag and reports it in its status. Each agent session runs a short-lived `orcker mcp` process that reads it, so turning it **on** reaches agent sessions already running (on their next tool call), while turning it **off** applies to sessions started afterwards. See the [AI Agents guide](../guide/ai-agents).

::: warning Not a security boundary
The flag gates tool *discovery*, not access. Any process running as your user can already talk to Orcker's daemon through its socket - that is how the `orcker` CLI works - so turning this off does not isolate Orcker from local software.
:::

### `[ports]`

The HTTP and HTTPS listen ports for the proxy, plus the rootless ports the daemon falls back to when it can't bind the privileged ones.

| Key              | TOML type     | Meaning                                                                          | Default |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `http`           | integer (u16) | HTTP listen port.                                                                | `80`    |
| `https`          | integer (u16) | HTTPS listen port.                                                               | `443`   |
| `fallback_http`  | integer (u16) | Rootless HTTP port the daemon drops to when `http` can't bind without elevation. | `8080`  |
| `fallback_https` | integer (u16) | Rootless HTTPS port the daemon drops to when `https` can't bind without elevation. | `8443`  |

The default is the IANA well-known pair `80 / 443`. Binding these privileged ports may require elevation on macOS and Linux - see [Elevation & Privileges](../guide/elevation). If you would rather avoid elevation, switch to the unprivileged fallback pair `8080 / 8443`:

```toml
[ports]
http = 8080
https = 8443
```

`fallback_http` and `fallback_https` are what the daemon binds instead of `http`/`https` when it starts in degraded mode - unable to acquire the privileged ports without elevation - so the proxy still comes up rather than failing to start. They're editable from the desktop app's Settings > Web ports card as well as by hand.

Validation rules (enforced by `Config::validate`): neither `http` nor `https` may be `0`, and they must differ (`HttpPortZero`, `HttpsPortZero`, `HttpHttpsPortsEqual`). Both fallback ports must be `>= 1024` - the fallback exists specifically to avoid needing elevation, so a privileged fallback is rejected (`FallbackPortPrivileged`) - and `fallback_http`/`fallback_https` must differ from each other (`FallbackPortsEqual`).

### `[php]`

PHP defaults applied across sites.

| Key                | TOML type | Meaning                                                      | Default |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `default`          | string    | Default PHP version for new sites (e.g. `"8.3"`).            | `"8.3"` |
| `settings`         | table     | Global PHP ini directives applied to every installed version's FPM pool. | empty   |
| `version_settings` | table     | Sparse per-version overrides of `settings`, keyed by PHP version. | empty   |
| `directives`       | table     | Free-form per-version ini directives, keyed by PHP version.  | empty   |
| `pool`             | table     | Per-version FPM pool settings, keyed by PHP version.         | empty   |
| `extensions`       | table     | Custom `.so` extensions to load, keyed by PHP version.       | empty   |

`default` is a `MAJOR.MINOR` version string validated by `orcker-core`'s `PhpVersion`; an out-of-range minor or a non-numeric value is rejected. See [PHP Versions](../guide/php-versions).

`[php.settings]` is a string-to-string map of PHP ini directives written into **every** installed version's FPM pool. An empty map means "use PHP's defaults" and the table is omitted from the file entirely. Only an allowlisted set of directives is accepted, and every value is validated as a security boundary (no control characters, none of the FPM/ini metacharacters `[ ] = ; #`, length ≤ 256 bytes). The supported directives are:

| Directive             | Value shape                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `memory_limit`        | byte size (`512M`); also accepts `-1` for unlimited           |
| `max_execution_time`  | non-negative integer                                          |
| `max_input_time`      | non-negative integer                                          |
| `max_file_uploads`    | non-negative integer                                          |
| `upload_max_filesize` | byte size (`64M`)                                             |
| `post_max_size`       | byte size (`64M`)                                             |
| `display_errors`      | boolean flag (`On` / `Off`, rendered as a `php_flag`)         |
| `error_reporting`     | integer or constant expression (e.g. `E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED`) |

```toml
[php.settings]
memory_limit = "512M"
max_execution_time = "300"
upload_max_filesize = "64M"
```

::: warning Setting an unsupported directive fails the load
An unknown directive name or a malformed value makes the whole config invalid (`InvalidPhpSetting`). Stick to the table above.
:::

`[php.version_settings."<version>"]` (schema v16) holds **per-version
overrides** of the same allowlisted settings, keyed by PHP version string. A
version's effective value is its override when present, else the global
`[php.settings]` value, else PHP's built-in default. Omitted entirely when no
overrides are set.

`[php.directives."<version>"]` (schema v18) holds **free-form ini directives**
per version - typically extension settings the allowlist doesn't cover
(`xdebug.mode`, `opcache.*`, …). Names must start with a letter or `_` and use
only letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`; values follow the same injection rules as
`[php.settings]` (no control characters or `[ ] = ; #`, ≤ 256 bytes).
Directives Orcker manages through typed paths are reserved: the eight allowlisted
settings, `extension` / `zend_extension`, and `openssl.cafile` / `curl.cainfo`.

`[php.pool."<version>"]` (schema v20) holds **FPM pool settings** for that
version's worker pool. The only key is `max_children`, the ceiling on
concurrent PHP workers, accepted between `1` and `1024` and defaulting to `16`
when absent. These are pool-block settings rather than ini directives, so they
apply to the FPM pool only and never reach the version's CLI `php.ini`. The
pool runs `ondemand`, so a higher ceiling costs nothing while idle. Because
`pm.*` names are reserved out of `[php.directives]`, this is the only place a
pool setting can be set.

```toml
[php.version_settings."8.3"]
memory_limit = "1G"

[php.directives."8.3"]
"xdebug.mode" = "debug"

[php.pool."8.3"]
max_children = "32"
```

::: tip These three tables load leniently
Unlike `[php.settings]`, a hand-edited invalid or reserved entry in
`version_settings` / `directives` / `pool` never fails the load - it is silently
dropped while valid siblings survive, so a bad edit can't stop the daemon.
Setting values through the CLI/GUI still validates strictly. A malformed
*version key* (e.g. `"eight"`) is still a hard error.
:::

Manage these with [`orcker set php --only <version>`, `orcker php ini`, and `orcker php pool`](cli/php#custom-ini-directives) or the desktop app's **Per-version configuration** card.

`[php.extensions]` maps a **PHP version string** to an array of custom extensions to load into both that version's FPM pool and its CLI. It is written as an array-of-tables per version and omitted entirely when empty. Because a native `.so` is ABI-bound to a PHP minor, an entry only applies to the version it is keyed under.

| Field  | TOML type | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name` | string    | Removal/display handle (defaults to the `.so` basename when added).     |
| `path` | string    | Absolute path to the `.so`. Validated as a security boundary: must be absolute, end in `.so`, and contain no control characters, NUL, `"`, or `$` (spaces are allowed - the rendered ini value is double-quoted, and `$` is rejected because PHP would interpolate `${VAR}` inside it). |
| `zend` | bool      | Load as a `zend_extension` rather than a plain `extension`.             |

```toml
[[php.extensions."8.5"]]
name = "scrypt"
path = "/opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20250925/scrypt.so"
zend = false
```

Manage this with [`orcker php ext`](cli/php#custom-extensions) or the Extensions section of the desktop app's **Per-version configuration** card rather than editing by hand - the CLI/daemon **load-probe** each `.so` before saving. Names must be unique within a version; a duplicate or an invalid path makes the whole config invalid.

### `[parked]`

Directories you have "parked" - every immediate subdirectory becomes a site served under `<dirname>.<tld>`. See [Sites](../guide/sites).

| Key     | TOML type        | Meaning                              | Default |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `paths` | array of strings | Parked directory paths.              | `[]`    |

Paths are stored **verbatim** as UTF-8 strings and are **not canonicalised** by the config layer - `"/srv/foo"` and `"/srv/foo/"` are distinct entries. They are kept in sorted order with no duplicates. An empty-string path is rejected (`ParkedPathEmpty`).

```toml
[parked]
paths = ["/Users/you/Sites", "/Users/you/work"]
```

### `[[linked]]`

Explicitly registered sites, each as its own array-of-tables entry. Order is preserved on round-trip.

| Key             | TOML type | Meaning                                            |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | string    | Site name (the subdomain under your TLD).          |
| `document_root` | string    | Path to the site's project directory.              |
| `web_subpath`   | string    | Served web root, relative to `document_root`. Optional. |
| `php`           | string    | PHP version for this site (e.g. `"8.3"`).          |
| `secure`        | boolean   | Whether HTTPS is enabled for this site.            |
| `kind`          | string    | `"linked"` or `"parked"`.                          |

`name`, `document_root`, `php`, `secure`, and `kind` are required per entry. `name`, `php`, and `kind` are validated by `orcker-core`; for example an invalid site name like `"FOO.BAR"` is rejected. Linked site names must be unique - a duplicate produces `DuplicateLinkedSite`.

`web_subpath` is the directory actually served, relative to `document_root` (e.g. `"public"` for Laravel; empty/absent means "serve the document root itself"). It is **optional and omitted from the file when empty**, so a site served from its project root has no `web_subpath` line. It must be a plain relative path - an absolute path or one containing `..` is rejected (`WebRootEscapes`) so a hand-edited value can never escape the project. Orcker normally sets this for you via framework detection; see [Web root](../guide/sites#web-root-the-served-directory).

```toml
[[linked]]
name = "api"
document_root = "/Users/you/projects/api"
web_subpath = "public"
php = "8.3"
secure = true
kind = "linked"
```

### `[[overrides]]`

Per-site overrides for **parked** sites, each its own array-of-tables entry. A parked site is otherwise derived purely from a directory listing, so it has nowhere to persist a custom PHP version or HTTPS flag. Rather than promoting it to a linked site (which would change its kind), the daemon records the override here and re-applies it during the directory scan, leaving the site parked.

| Key        | TOML type | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`     | string    | The parked site's document-root path. **Required.**          |
| `php`      | string    | Pinned PHP version. Omit to inherit the global default.       |
| `secure`   | boolean   | Pinned HTTPS flag. Omit to inherit (off).                     |
| `web_root` | string    | Pinned web root, relative to `path`. Omit to auto-detect.     |
| `front_controller` | boolean | Pinned front-controller mode. Omit to auto-derive from detection. |

`php`, `secure`, `web_root`, and `front_controller` are all optional - omitting a key means "inherit" (or, for `web_root`/`front_controller`, "auto-derive on every scan"). An entry may pin one, several, or (uselessly) none. The serialiser skips omitted keys, so a partial override stays tidy on disk. Like `web_subpath` on a linked site, `web_root` must be a plain relative path inside the project (`WebRootEscapes` otherwise). Setting `web_root` is what `orcker root <parked-site> <path>` does; setting `front_controller` is what `orcker front-controller <parked-site> on|off` does.

`front_controller = true` funnels every request through the site-root `index.php` (the right behaviour for a single-front-controller framework such as Laravel or Symfony); `false` executes a named `.php` under the served root directly (classic multi-page PHP). When omitted, the mode is auto-derived: a framework served from a subdirectory (non-empty `web_root`/`web_subpath`) defaults to front-controller mode, while WordPress (any layout) and plain root-served sites default to direct execution. The same key is accepted inside a `[[linked]]` entry.

::: warning Direct execution exposes every `.php` in the served root
With direct execution (the default for a plain root-served site), any real `.php` file under the served root is URL-executable - including a stray `phpinfo.php` or a leftover admin tool. If the site is exposed beyond loopback via a tunnel, those files are remotely reachable. Set `front_controller = true` (or point `web_root` at a clean public directory) to funnel everything through `index.php` instead.
:::

```toml
# Pin PHP, HTTPS, and the served web root for one parked site...
[[overrides]]
path = "/Users/you/Sites/blog"
php = "8.4"
secure = true
web_root = "public"

# ...and only HTTPS for another (PHP and web root inherit / auto-detect).
[[overrides]]
path = "/Users/you/Sites/wiki"
secure = false
```

::: warning `path` must match byte-for-byte
The `path` key is the parked site's document-root string, stored **byte-exact and never canonicalised** - it must match exactly the path the daemon's directory scan produces. Do not canonicalise, trim, or add a trailing slash by hand, or the override won't be applied. An empty `path` is rejected (`OverridePathEmpty`).
:::

### `[services.<id>]`

Installed services, one table per engine, keyed by its `id`
(`mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `redis`, or `meilisearch`). An unknown service id fails
validation (`UnknownService`). See [Services & Databases](../guide/services).

| Key         | TOML type      | Meaning                                            | Default |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `version`   | string         | Installed version this engine is pinned to.        | unset   |
| `port`      | integer (u16)  | Loopback port the engine listens on.               | unset   |
| `enabled`   | boolean        | Record of the last start/stop intent (status only). | `true`  |
| `overrides` | table          | Free-form engine config directives (see below).    | empty   |

`version` and `port` are omitted from the wire when unset; `enabled` always carries a value.

::: tip
`enabled` no longer gates boot auto-start - the daemon auto-starts **every installed** engine regardless of this flag. A `stop` lasts only the current session; `uninstall` to keep an engine off. See [Services & Databases](../guide/services#auto-start-on-boot).
:::

```toml
[services.mysql]
version = "8.4"
port = 3306
enabled = true

[services.redis]
version = "8"
port = 6379
enabled = true
```

You normally manage these through the [`orcker service`](../reference/cli/services) commands rather than by hand.

`[services.<id>.overrides]` (schema v22) is a string-to-string map of **free-form
directives for the engine's own config file**. On every start Orcker renders them
into that service's `conf.d/10-orcker.<ext>` sidecar, which the Orcker-owned config
includes *after* its own settings - so an override wins over Orcker's default for
the same directive. Empty by default, and omitted from the file entirely when
empty. Setting one never restarts anything: it reaches the engine on the next
start/restart, exactly like `port`.

Only the config-backed engines accept overrides - `mysql`, `mariadb`,
`postgres`, and `redis`. Meilisearch and Reverb are argv/env driven, so they have
no config file to override and keep none.

Names must start with a letter or `_` and use only letters, digits, `.`, `_`,
`-`. Values are ≤ 512 bytes with no control characters, `;`, or `#` (and, outside
PostgreSQL, no quote characters - an unbalanced quote aborts the whole config
load). Validation is **shape only**: whether the engine accepts a directive is
the engine's business. Directives Orcker manages through typed paths are reserved -
the port, the data directory, the socket, the pid file, logging, the
MySQL/MariaDB bootstrap `init-file`, the loopback binding, and the engines' own
`include` directives. Matching is case-insensitive in every dialect, and the
MySQL family also folds `-` and `_`, so `Bind_Address` is refused just as
`bind-address` is.

```toml
[services.mysql.overrides]
max_allowed_packet = "256M"
max_connections = "500"
sql_mode = "STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE"

[services.redis.overrides]
maxmemory = "256mb"
maxmemory-policy = "allkeys-lru"
```

::: tip This table loads leniently
Like `[php.directives]`, a hand-edited invalid or reserved entry here never fails
the load - it is silently dropped while its valid siblings survive, so a bad edit
can't stop the daemon. An overrides table under a service that accepts none
(`meilisearch`, `reverb:<site>`) is inert rather than fatal. Setting a value
through the CLI or desktop app still validates strictly, and refuses a reserved
directive with a hint naming the command that manages it.
:::

Manage these with [`orcker service set` / `unset` / `overrides`](cli/services#configuration)
or the desktop app's **Override settings** dialog. Hand edits that must survive
untouched belong in the service's own `conf.d/50-local.<ext>` file rather than
here - see [Service configuration overrides](../guide/services#service-configuration-overrides).

### `[mail]`

The built-in mail-capture SMTP server - a Herd-style sink that accepts mail on a loopback port and stores it for inspection in the desktop app. **Capture is on by default.**

| Key       | TOML type     | Meaning                                                | Default |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `enabled` | boolean       | Whether the daemon starts the capture server on boot.  | `true`  |
| `port`    | integer (u16) | Loopback port the capture server binds on `127.0.0.1`. | `2525`  |

When enabled the daemon binds `port` on `127.0.0.1`; a busy port is non-fatal - the daemon logs and runs with capture not listening. Validation rejects `port = 0` (`MailPortZero`).

Because the section's default (enabled, port `2525`) is the common case, the serialiser **omits `[mail]` entirely when it matches the default** - so a default file has no `[mail]` table at all. The table is written only once a value differs from the default.

```toml
[mail]
enabled = true
port = 2525
```

### `[dumps]`

Telemetry settings for the Laravel ▸ Dumps feature. The dump server buffers per-request telemetry frames from the `orcker-php-ext` extension; this section is the durable source of truth (the daemon writes a runtime mirror the extension reads each request). **Disabled by default.**

| Key       | TOML type     | Meaning                                                              | Default |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `enabled` | boolean       | Whether dump interception is on (the "antenna").                    | `false` |
| `port`    | integer (u16) | Loopback port the dump server listens on / the extension connects to. | `2304`  |
| `persist` | boolean       | When `false`, the buffer is cleared on each new request (latest-request view); `true` accumulates across requests. | `false` |
| `features`| table         | Per-feature capture toggles (see below).                            | empty   |

Validation rejects `port = 0` (`DumpsPortZero`).

`[dumps.features]` is a map of feature name → bool. The keys are `dumps`, `queries`, `jobs`, `views`, `requests`, `logs`, and `cache`. **An absent key means "on"**, so the table only needs entries for features you have turned *off*. An empty map (every feature on) is omitted from the file, and so is the whole `[dumps]` table when it matches the default (disabled, port `2304`, no overrides).

```toml
[dumps]
enabled = true
port = 2304
persist = false

[dumps.features]
queries = false   # absent keys default to on; only the off ones need listing
```

### `[tunnel]`

Persisted state for [sharing sites](../guide/sharing) through Cloudflare Tunnel. Two maps, both **empty by default** - the whole `[tunnel]` table is omitted from the file until you create a named tunnel or expose a site. Quick-tunnel state is never persisted (it lives only in the running daemon).

| Sub-table        | Shape                     | Meaning                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[tunnel.named]` | map `name → uuid`         | The named tunnels created on your Cloudflare account.         |
| `[tunnel.sites]` | map `site → hostname`     | Per-site public hostnames exposed through the named tunnel.   |

Validation rejects empty keys/values (`TunnelEntryEmpty`), a `[tunnel.sites]` hostname that isn't a plausible DNS name (`TunnelHostnameInvalid`), and any key or UUID containing path- or YAML-unsafe characters (`TunnelKeyInvalid`). The account certificate and per-tunnel credentials are **not** stored here - they live in a daemon-owned `0700` directory, never in the config file.

```toml
[tunnel.named]
my-tunnel = "6ff42ae2-765d-4adf-8112-31c55c1551ef"

[tunnel.sites]
app = "app.example.com"
```

### `[groups]`

User-defined site groups for the desktop app's Sites view. Purely an organisational overlay - groups do not affect routing. Both fields are **empty by default**, so the whole `[groups]` table is omitted from the file until you create a group.

| Key       | TOML type        | Meaning                                                        |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `order`   | array of strings  | Group display names, in display order.                        |
| `members` | table (`site → group`) | Per-site group membership, keyed by site name.           |

Membership is keyed by **site name**, not document-root, so a group applies to parked and linked sites alike without touching either site's own record. A site absent from `members` is "Unallocated" - the GUI's synthetic bucket for ungrouped sites, which is never itself persisted here.

Validation rules (enforced by `Config::validate`): every name in `order` must be non-empty (`GroupNameEmpty`) and unique, ASCII-case-insensitively (`GroupDuplicate`); the name `Unallocated` is reserved in any casing and rejected (`GroupNameReserved`); and every `members` value must reference a group present in `order`, also folding case (`GroupMemberDangling`). Whether a keyed site still exists is not checked - parked sites are discovered from disk on each scan and have no config record to check against.

```toml
[groups]
order = ["Blog", "Shop"]

[groups.members]
api = "Blog"
```

### `[domains]`

Domain customization for a site **or a whole-host proxy**: the primary (canonical) domain plus any additional aliases, subdomains, and wildcards it answers for. **Empty by default** - the whole `[domains]` table is omitted until you customise something with [`orcker domain`](./cli/domains). An uncustomised site or proxy answers only its default apex `<name>.<tld>`; subdomains do **not** resolve implicitly.

The table is split by claimant class, the first two mirroring `[[overrides]]`:

| Key                | TOML type                 | Meaning                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[domains.linked]` | table (`name → delta`)    | Deltas for **linked** sites, keyed by site name.                |
| `[domains.parked]` | table (`docroot → delta`) | Deltas for **parked** sites, keyed by byte-exact document-root. |
| `[domains.proxy]`  | table (`name → delta`)    | Deltas for **whole-host proxies**, keyed by proxy name.         |

Keying linked by name and parked by document-root matches `[[overrides]]`, so routing survives a directory rename and a parked site keeps its domains without a config record of its own.

Each entry is a **delta** over the default apex, with three optional fields:

| Field        | TOML type        | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `added`      | array of strings | Extra domains the site answers for (exact or single-label wildcard). |
| `suppressed` | array of strings | Default domains to drop (only ever the apex).                        |
| `primary`    | string           | The canonical domain (must be exact, never a wildcard).              |

Values are stored as **sub-parts** - the part left of the TLD, exactly as the router matches - not full FQDNs. Under TLD `test`, `corp.test` is stored as `corp`, `*.blog.test` as `*.blog`, and the apex `blog.test` as `blog`. A leftmost `*` is a single-label wildcard (`*.blog` matches `api.blog.test`, never `x.api.blog.test`).

`Config::validate` enforces only structural rules (no duplicate `added`; `added` and `suppressed` disjoint; `primary` not a wildcard). TLD membership, cross-site uniqueness, and "keep at least one exact domain" are enforced by the daemon, which alone can see parked sites on disk.

```toml
[domains.linked.blog]
added = ["corp", "*.blog"]
suppressed = ["blog"]
primary = "corp"

[domains.parked."/Users/me/Sites/shop"]
added = ["shop-staging"]
```

### `[[proxies]]`

Whole-host reverse proxies - a `<name>.<tld>` host forwarded wholesale to a
running service, with no PHP or document root. **Empty by default** (the array
is omitted from the file) until you add one with [`orcker proxy`](./cli/proxies).
Order is preserved on round-trip.

| Field    | TOML type | Meaning                                                         |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`   | string    | One or more dot-separated DNS labels (`reverb`, `api.account`). `<name>.<tld>` is its **default** domain; [`[domains.proxy]`](#domains) can add more and, once another exact domain exists, replace or suppress the default. |
| `target` | string    | The upstream URL, `http://host:port` or `https://host:port`.    |
| `secure` | bool      | Whether the proxy is served over HTTPS (toggled by `orcker secure`). |

```toml
[[proxies]]
name = "reverb"
target = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
secure = true
```

### `[proxy_rules]`

Per-site path-prefix proxy rules - a path on an existing site forwarded to a
service while every other path is served by PHP. **Empty by default** (the whole
table is omitted) until you add a rule. Split by site class exactly like
`[domains]`: linked rules key by site name, parked rules by byte-exact
document-root, so routing survives a directory rename.

| Key                    | TOML type                       | Meaning                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `[proxy_rules.linked]` | table (`name → array of rules`) | Rules for **linked** sites, keyed by name.    |
| `[proxy_rules.parked]` | table (`docroot → array`)       | Rules for **parked** sites, keyed by docroot. |

Each rule is a `{ prefix, target }` table. Removing a site's last rule drops its
key entirely, so the file round-trips byte-identically.

```toml
[[proxy_rules.linked.myapp]]
prefix = "/app"
target = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

`Config::validate` enforces the structural rules it can see (proxy names unique
among proxies and against linked sites; a site's rule prefixes unique; no target
pointing at a `.<tld>` host). Collisions with parked sites and the
loopback-on-own-port loop guard are enforced by the daemon, which alone knows
the actively bound ports and sees parked sites on disk.

### `[route_rules]`

Per-site path-prefix **routing** rules (schema v21) - URIs under a prefix that
match no real file are handled by a target *inside the site*. **Empty by
default** (the whole table is omitted) until you add a rule. Split by site class
exactly like `[proxy_rules]` and `[domains]`: linked rules key by site name,
parked rules by byte-exact document-root, so routing survives a directory
rename.

| Key                    | TOML type                       | Meaning                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `[route_rules.linked]` | table (`name → array of rules`) | Rules for **linked** sites, keyed by name.    |
| `[route_rules.parked]` | table (`docroot → array`)       | Rules for **parked** sites, keyed by docroot. |

Each rule is a `{ prefix, target }` table, where `target` is a path **relative to
the site's served root**. Removing a site's last rule drops its key entirely, so
the file round-trips byte-identically.

```toml
# A legacy portal with a nested Yii/CodeIgniter API at /api
[[route_rules.linked.portal]]
prefix = "/api"
target = "api/index.php"

# A JavaScript SPA: history-API deep links serve the app shell
[[route_rules.linked.dashboard]]
prefix = "/"
target = "index.html"
```

A rule applies only when the request matched no real file - exactly nginx's
`try_files $uri $uri/ <target>`. A `.php` target runs as a nested front
controller and accepts every HTTP method; anything else is served as a static
document and answers only `GET`/`HEAD`. The `target` is validated as a **safe
relative path** at load, so a hand-edited absolute path or one containing `..` is
a hard parse error rather than a silent security hole.

::: warning Not the same as `[proxy_rules]`
A proxy rule forwards to a separate running HTTP service; a routing rule resolves
to a file inside the site's own tree. When a site has both on the same prefix,
the proxy rule wins - it intercepts before PHP resolution runs at all.
:::

Manage these with [`orcker route`](cli/routes), or the **Routing** tab of the
desktop app's site details sidebar. A site whose web root holds an `index.html`
and no `index.php` gets SPA routing automatically, with no rule stored here.

## Schema versioning and migration

Every config file **must** carry a top-level `version = N` key - it is the single trigger for forward migration. The current schema version is `23`.

When the daemon loads a file, it routes on the version it finds:

```text
found  > CURRENT (18)   →  error (UnsupportedVersion) - a newer Orcker wrote this file
found == CURRENT (18)   →  parse directly
found  < CURRENT (18)   →  walk forward migration steps, then parse
```

A file written by a *newer* Orcker than you are running is refused rather than misread. Older files are migrated forward in place, one version at a time, before the normal wire-deserialisation and validation run:

- **`v1 → v2`** is a bare version bump: v2 only **added** the optional `web_subpath` (`[[linked]]`) and `web_root` (`[[overrides]]`) keys, which default when absent, so a v1 file needs no structural rewrite.
- **`v2 → v3`** is the first *structural* migration: it rewrites the old `[services]` shape (a flat `enabled = ["redis", ...]` array of identifiers) into per-service `[services.<id>]` tables, carrying each previously-enabled id forward as an `enabled = true` instance.
- **`v3 → v4`** is a bare version bump: v4 only **added** the optional `[mail]` section, which defaults when absent, so a v3 file needs no structural rewrite. The bump exists so an *older* binary rejects a file using `[mail]` cleanly as `UnsupportedVersion` rather than failing on the unknown table.
- **`v4 → v5`** is likewise a bare version bump: v5 only **added** the optional `[dumps]` table, which defaults when absent. Same rationale - the bump lets an older binary refuse a `[dumps]`-bearing file cleanly instead of tripping `deny_unknown_fields`.
- **`v5 → v6`** is a bare version bump: v6 only **added** the top-level `update_channel` scalar (defaults to `"stable"` when absent).
- **`v6 → v7`** is a bare version bump: v7 only **added** the `[ports]` `fallback_http` / `fallback_https` keys (defaulting to `8080` / `8443`).
- **`v7 → v8`** is a bare version bump: v8 only **added** the optional `[tunnel]` table, which defaults to empty when absent. Same rationale - the bump lets an older binary refuse a `[tunnel]`-bearing file cleanly rather than tripping `deny_unknown_fields`.
- **`v8 → v9`** is a bare version bump: v9 only **added** the optional `[groups]` table, which defaults to empty when absent. Same rationale - the bump lets an older binary refuse a `[groups]`-bearing file cleanly rather than tripping `deny_unknown_fields`.
- **`v9 → v10`** is a bare version bump: v10 **added** the optional `[php.extensions]` registry and the `wp_auto_login` / `wp_auto_login_user` keys (inside `[[linked]]` and `[[overrides]]`, for one-click `WordPress` admin login), all of which default when absent. Same rationale - the bump lets an older binary refuse a file using them cleanly rather than tripping `deny_unknown_fields`.
- **`v10 → v11`** is a bare version bump: v11 only **added** the optional `[domains]` table (per-site domain sets), which defaults to empty when absent. Same rationale - the bump lets an older binary refuse a `[domains]`-bearing file cleanly rather than tripping `deny_unknown_fields`. No existing keys change, so a v10 file needs no structural rewrite.
- **`v11 → v12`** is a bare version bump: v12 only **added** the top-level `symlink_protection` scalar (defaults to `true` when absent).
- **`v12 → v13`** is a bare version bump: v13 only **added** the optional per-site `front_controller` key (inside `[[linked]]` and `[[overrides]]`), which defaults to auto when absent.
- **`v13 → v14`** is a bare version bump: v14 only **added** the optional `[[proxies]]` array and `[proxy_rules]` table (reverse proxies and per-site path rules), both of which default to empty when absent. Same rationale - the bump lets an older binary refuse a proxy-bearing file cleanly rather than tripping `deny_unknown_fields`.
- **`v14 → v15`** is the multi-instance services rework: v15 **added** the optional per-instance `site` field and the `"{type}:{site}"` wire ids (both additive), and made the `enabled` flag actually gate boot autostart. The migration marks every existing single-instance engine `enabled = true` so previously-installed engines keep starting with Orcker across the upgrade.
- **`v15 → v16`** is a bare version bump: v16 only **added** the optional `[php.version_settings]` table (per-version overrides of the global PHP settings), which defaults to empty when absent.
- **`v16 → v17`** is a bare version bump: v17 only **added** the top-level `mcp_enabled` scalar (defaults to `false` when absent).
- **`v17 → v18`** is a bare version bump: v18 only **added** the optional `[php.directives]` table (free-form per-version ini directives), which defaults to empty when absent.
- **`v18 → v19`** is a bare version bump: v19 only **added** the top-level `lan_enabled` and `lan_setup_port` scalars (LAN exposure and its remote-setup port), which default to `false` / `7073` when absent.
- **`v19 → v20`** is a bare version bump: v20 only **added** the optional `[php.pool]` table (per-version FPM pool settings), which defaults to empty when absent.
- **`v20 → v21`** is a bare version bump: v21 only **added** the optional `[route_rules]` table (per-site path-prefix routing rules), which defaults to empty when absent.
- **`v21 → v22`** is a bare version bump: v22 only **added** the optional `[services.<id>.overrides]` sub-table (free-form engine config directives), which defaults to empty when absent.
- **`v22 → v23`** is a bare version bump: v23 only **added** the optional `[domains.proxy]` table (routable-domain deltas for whole-host proxies), which defaults to empty when absent.

The on-disk schema version is deliberately decoupled from the IPC protocol version; the two evolve independently.

::: warning Downgrades are refused, not misread
Because later versions changed shapes the parser checks strictly (keys *inside* `[[linked]]` / `[[overrides]]` in v2, and the whole `[services]` shape in v3), an older daemon reading a newer file would fail. The version routing turns that into a clean `UnsupportedVersion` error instead - there is no automatic backward migration, but it fails loudly rather than corrupting state. See [Config Schema History](../developer/config-schema-history#downgrading-in-practice) for the exact manual edits to hand-downgrade a file version by version.
:::

::: tip Forward-compatible by design
The parser tolerates older shapes: a v1 file written before `web_subpath`/`web_root` existed migrates to v2 and parses fine (the new fields default). New optional fields are added additively, so upgrades don't break your existing config.
:::

## Atomic saves

Saves are atomic. The daemon serialises the config, writes it to a temporary file in the same directory, then `rename`s it over `orcker.toml`. Because the temp file lives on the same filesystem as the destination, the rename is atomic on Unix - a reader never sees a half-written file, and a crash mid-save leaves the previous config intact. On failure the temp file is cleaned up automatically, so no orphan files are left behind.

On Unix the file is created with mode `0600` (owner read/write only): the daemon is the only intended writer. Intermediate parent directories are created as needed.

::: info Durability trade-off
Orcker does not `fsync` the file or its parent directory after a save. For a developer-only config file the portability cost outweighs the durability gain, so a loss under sudden power loss is accepted by design.
