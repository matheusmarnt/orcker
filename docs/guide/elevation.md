# Elevation & Privileges

Orcker is rootless by design. The daemon (`orckerd`), the CLI (`orcker`), and the desktop app all run as your normal user. Only one step needs administrator rights: a one-time setup that wires Orcker into three OS subsystems your account can't touch on its own. Everything after that (parking sites, switching PHP, securing a site, restarting a pool) runs unprivileged.

## Why elevation is needed

Three things can't be done as an unprivileged user, on any OS:

1. **Trusting the local CA.** Orcker issues per-site certificates from a local CA. For the browser to show a padlock, that CA must go into the root-owned system trust store.
2. **Configuring the system resolver.** Routing `*.test` to Orcker's DNS responder means editing the OS resolver config under `/etc` (`/etc/resolver/<tld>` on macOS, or Orcker-owned systemd-resolved/NetworkManager snippets on Linux).
3. **Binding ports 80 and 443.** These are privileged ports; an unprivileged process can't bind them without help.

Herd and Valet require the same admin steps for the same reasons.

::: tip You don't have to elevate
Skip setup and Orcker still works: it falls back to [rootless ports `8080`/`8443`](#the-rootless-fallback), serving over `http://...:8080` (or you trust the CA yourself). Elevation buys the "just type the URL" experience, not basic functionality.
:::

## The one command

Run this once for the full experience. It's the only Orcker command that uses root:

```sh
sudo orcker elevate
```

With no subcommand, `elevate` does all three steps in order (trust, resolver, ports). Each runs independently, so a failure or skip in one doesn't abort the rest.

You can run one piece at a time:

```sh
sudo orcker elevate trust       # add the local CA to the system trust store
sudo orcker elevate resolver    # route *.test to orcker's DNS responder
sudo orcker elevate ports       # allow the daemon to serve on 80/443
```

Resolver elevation first checks the daemon's DNS health. If Orcker could not bind
its configured DNS port, the command stops before changing OS resolver files and
names the port to free (or change); restart Orcker after correcting it, then retry.

| Target | What it configures |
|---|---|
| `trust` | Adds Orcker's local CA to the OS system trust store. |
| `resolver` | Routes `*.<tld>` (e.g. `*.test`) queries to Orcker's DNS responder. |
| `ports` | Lets the daemon serve on the privileged ports 80/443. |

::: tip Or use the GUI
The desktop app's **Doctor** page mirrors this exactly - a **Fix** button per row
(CA trust, `.test` resolver, privileged ports) runs the same `orcker elevate`
helper under an OS prompt, and once a row is configured an **Unelevate** button
reverts it.
:::

<ThemedImage light="/images/doctor-light.png" dark="/images/doctor-dark.png" alt="The Doctor page in the desktop app, with Fix and Unelevate buttons per row" />

Reverse any of it with `unelevate`, using the same targets:

```sh
sudo orcker unelevate           # revert everything elevate configured
sudo orcker unelevate trust     # remove the CA from the system trust store
sudo orcker unelevate resolver  # restore the prior resolver (macOS) / remove the route
```

::: tip Unelevate restores your previous resolver
On macOS, if `elevate resolver` replaced a pre-existing `/etc/resolver/<tld>` (a Valet/Herd leftover), it saved a backup. `unelevate resolver` **restores that backup** - returning DNS to its pre-Orcker state - and then clears the saved backups; with no backup it just removes Orcker's file. On Linux it removes all Orcker-owned systemd-resolved and NetworkManager snippets. `unelevate ports` is reversible on macOS only (see [Ports](#ports)).
:::

::: tip Removing orcker entirely
`sudo orcker uninstall` runs this same `unelevate` (all three targets) as part of a full removal, then deletes the daemon, config, data, and binaries. Run it **with `sudo`** so the trust/resolver/port changes are reversed - they can't be undone once the `orcker-helper` binary is gone. See the [Uninstall reference](../reference/cli/uninstall).
:::

::: info The helper only removes its own CA
`unelevate trust` (and the full uninstall) ask `orcker-helper` to remove a CA from the system trust store **by fingerprint**. Before deleting, the helper confirms the matched certificate is actually Orcker's (its Subject CN is `Orcker Local CA`) - so a stray or mistaken fingerprint can never make the privileged helper delete an unrelated trusted root. If it can't confirm ownership, it refuses and leaves the cert in place.
:::

::: warning Start the daemon first
`elevate` reads facts from your running daemon over the per-user socket (CA path and fingerprint, TLD, DNS address, rootless ports). If it isn't running you'll see `start the orcker daemon first, then re-run`. Start `orckerd` as your user, then re-run `sudo orcker elevate`.
:::

## What each target does, per OS

The mechanics differ by platform; the intent is identical.

### Trust

The CA cert is added to the system store, then the store is refreshed:

- **macOS:** added to `/Library/Keychains/System.keychain` as a trusted root (`security add-trusted-cert ... -r trustRoot`).
- **Linux:** copied into the distro's anchor directory and the store is rebuilt:
  - `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` then `update-ca-certificates` (Debian/Ubuntu)
  - `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` then `update-ca-trust extract` (RHEL/Fedora)
  - `/etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors` then `trust extract-compat` (Arch)

`elevate trust` then also updates your **browsers**. On Linux (and for Firefox
on macOS), Chromium-family browsers - Brave, Chrome, Chromium, Edge - and
Firefox keep their **own** per-user certificate store (NSS) and ignore the
system store above, so the system-store step alone is not enough for them. Orcker
adds the CA to `~/.pki/nssdb` (shared by Chromium-family) and to each Firefox
profile, including Snap and Flatpak copies. This runs unprivileged as your user,
so the browser stores stay user-owned.

::: warning Browsers need `certutil`
Updating the browser stores requires `certutil`, which is **not installed by
default** on many distros. If Orcker reports it missing (and `orcker doctor` warns
`CaNotTrustedByBrowsers`), install it and re-run `sudo orcker elevate trust`:

- Debian/Ubuntu/Zorin: `sudo apt install libnss3-tools`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install nss-tools`
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S nss`
- macOS (only needed for Firefox; Safari/Chrome/Brave use the keychain): `brew install nss`

A newly installed browser that has never been launched has no store yet; launch
it once, then re-run `sudo orcker elevate trust`.
:::

See [HTTPS & Certificates](./https) for how the CA and leaf certs are generated.

### Resolver

- **macOS:** writes `/etc/resolver/<tld>` pointing at Orcker's DNS address, picked up at the next query (no restart). An existing file is backed up first, and `unelevate resolver` restores that backup.
- **Linux:** prefers a `systemd-resolved` drop-in. When `/etc/resolv.conf` positively identifies NetworkManager as its generator, Orcker can instead enable NetworkManager's dnsmasq plugin and add a per-TLD forwarding rule; this requires `dnsmasq` and `nmcli`. Other resolver arrangements are skipped, and Orcker never edits `/etc/resolv.conf` directly.

See [DNS & .test Domains](./dns) for the resolution model.

### Ports

The platforms diverge most here.

- **Linux:** grants `cap_net_bind_service=+ep` on the `orckerd` binary (`setcap`). The unprivileged daemon can then bind 80/443 directly. Restart the daemon (as your user) for it to take effect.

  ::: warning setcap is reset by upgrades
  The capability lives on the binary file, so replacing that file (a package upgrade) clears it. The Linux packages re-apply it on every upgrade (the `.deb`'s post-install and the Arch package's `.install` scriptlet); other install methods need `sudo orcker elevate ports` again after upgrading. There's no clean reverse, so `sudo orcker unelevate ports` only prints the manual command (`sudo setcap -r <path-to-orckerd>`).
  :::

- **macOS:** no `setcap`. The helper installs a `pf` redirect (`rdr`) mapping `80 -> http_port` and `443 -> https_port`, the rootless ports the daemon already bound. The daemon keeps its high ports; pf forwards the privileged ones. A `LaunchDaemon` re-applies the redirect at boot. It's live immediately (no restart) and fully reversible via `sudo orcker unelevate ports`. The daemon also polls for the redirect every few seconds, so a secure site's `http://` → `https://` redirect drops the `:8443`-style port from the URL shortly after you elevate (and brings it back if you `unelevate`) - no restart needed for that either.

## The rootless fallback

If you never run `elevate ports` (or it can't apply), the daemon falls back to high ports. When binding the desired pair fails with a recoverable error (`PermissionDenied`, `AddrInUse`, or `AddrNotAvailable`), it drops any partial listener and retries on the fallback:

| Service | Privileged | Rootless fallback |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP | 80 | 8080 |
| HTTPS | 443 | 8443 |

So without elevation you can reach sites at `http://my-app.test:8080` - **if** the resolver is installed.

::: tip Can't install the resolver at all?
If you have no admin rights to route `.test`, those names won't resolve anywhere. Orcker still serves every site through plain `localhost` - open `http://localhost:8080/~my-app.test`, or just `http://localhost:8080/` and pick from the list. See [Localhost Access](./localhost-access) for the full story (the `/~` switch, the picker, the `X-Orcker-Site` API header, and the caveats).
:::

Run [`orcker doctor`](./diagnostics) to see which ports are live and what to do.

::: warning If even the fallback can't bind
Rare, but possible if something else already holds the rootless ports too: the daemon comes up with no web listener at all. `orcker status` reports "not serving" for both ports, and `orcker doctor` raises a hard `WebPortsUnbound` failure. In this state `sudo orcker elevate ports` **refuses** on macOS - a `pf` redirect needs a live bound port to point at, and there isn't one. Free a port, or change the fallback pair in Settings (Orcker ▸ General), then restart the daemon before elevating. See [Diagnostics](./diagnostics).
:::

::: info macOS port status
The macOS daemon always binds its high ports (pf does the 80/443 forwarding), so Orcker probes reachability rather than trusting that a config file exists. The probe also **confirms it reaches Orcker's own proxy** - it speaks HTTP to `127.0.0.1:80` and checks for the proxy's `Server: orcker` marker - so a redirect you've torn down (or a foreign web server squatting the port) is correctly reported as *not* redirected. If something that isn't Orcker holds 80/443, `doctor` raises a [`ForeignWebListener`](./diagnostics) warning.
:::

## The security model

Elevation is tiny and tightly bounded. Orcker splits into three binaries with different privilege:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CLI["orcker (CLI, your user)"] -->|IPC socket| D["orckerd (daemon, your user)"]
    Elev["sudo orcker elevate"] -->|"spawns, once per target"| H["orcker-helper (root, one-shot)"]
```

- **`orckerd`** owns all runtime state, the proxy, DNS, and PHP-FPM pools. Never runs as root.
- **`orcker`** is a thin client. Under `sudo orcker elevate` it runs as root only to orchestrate; it never does the privileged operation itself.
- **`orcker-helper`** is a strict one-shot binary. Each invocation does exactly one validated operation and exits with a `sysexits.h`-style code.

The desktop app is also just a daemon client and never runs as root; its "Fix" actions shell out to `sudo orcker elevate ...` like you would, and the matching **Unelevate** buttons shell out to `sudo orcker unelevate ...` (behind an in-app confirm and the OS prompt). See [Features](./desktop-app).

### What makes `orcker-helper` safe

The helper trusts no caller, not even the daemon:

- **Effective-UID gate.** Refuses to run unless its effective UID is 0 (Linux reads `/proc/self/status`; macOS shells out to `/usr/bin/id` by absolute path). If `/proc` is missing it reports "not root" rather than assuming privilege.
- **Frozen, typed argv contract.** The CLI hands it one typed operation (`install-ca`, `uninstall-ca`, `install-resolver`, `uninstall-resolver`, `setcap`, `install-port-redirect`, `uninstall-port-redirect`), nothing else.
- **Re-validation.** Every argument is re-parsed before any side effect: paths must be absolute and existing, the TLD goes through `orcker-core`'s `Tld` type, and `setcap` is refused on any binary whose basename isn't `orckerd`.
- **Fingerprint-pinned CA install.** The helper reads the PEM, requires exactly one `CERTIFICATE` block, and verifies its SHA-256 matches the fingerprint passed on argv. This blocks swapping in a different PEM.
- **Hardened subprocesses.** Any tool it runs (`security`, `pfctl`, `update-ca-certificates`, `systemctl`, ...) is spawned with `env_clear()` and a pinned `PATH` (`/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`), with the working directory set to `/`. It never touches the network.
- **Atomic writes.** Files are written to a temp sibling, `fsync`'d, and `rename(2)`'d into place with the mode set at creation, so there's no create-then-chmod race.

On the orchestration side, `sudo orcker elevate` adds two guards:

- It derives the `orcker-helper` and `orckerd` paths from its own trusted `current_exe` siblings, never from anything the daemon says, so a forged daemon can't aim root's `setcap` at an arbitrary binary.
- Before trusting the daemon's CA path, it checks the path is owned by the invoking user (via `SUDO_UID`) and not group/world-writable.

## Reading the output

`elevate` narrates each step. A full run looks like:

```
==> trust: trusting the local CA in the system store
    ok
==> resolver: routing *.test → 127.0.0.1:1053
    ok
==> ports: granting cap_net_bind_service to orckerd
    ok
    restart the orcker daemon (as your user) for 80/443 to take effect.
```

Outcomes:

- **`ok`** - succeeded (operations are idempotent, so re-running is safe).
- **`skipped (unsupported on this host)`** - the target doesn't apply here (e.g. `resolver` on Linux without a positively detected supported manager). The run continues.
- **`failed: ...`** - a real error; that target's exit status is reported and the command exits non-zero, but the other targets still run.
