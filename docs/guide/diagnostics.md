# Diagnostics

Two commands cover almost everything:

- **`orcker status`** - a live daemon snapshot: ports, DNS, CA, PHP pools (PID and memory), and load.
- **`orcker doctor`** - runs every health check, sorts findings by severity, and prints the exact fix command for each. **`orcker doctor fix`** then auto-repairs the safe, unprivileged ones.

Both read from the daemon, which owns all runtime state. The CLI is a thin client, so `status`, `doctor`, and the desktop app never disagree about what's running.

## In the desktop app

The **Doctor** page (under the **System** group) mirrors the CLI's diagnostics in two panels. The **Health** list sorts every finding by severity - Healthy, Warning, or Problem - each with a copyable remedy command. **Run safe fixes** applies the safe one-click repairs (restarting a failed PHP-FPM pool), and **Re-check** re-runs diagnostics; on a healthy machine the list collapses to an "all clear" panel.

The same page carries an **Environment** panel for OS-level state, each row with a one-click action behind an OS prompt (the GUI never runs as root):

- **Local CA trusted** - whether HTTPS sites are trusted in the system store.
- **`.test` resolver installed** - whether the OS routes `*.test` to Orcker's DNS.
- **Privileged ports (80/443)** - whether the daemon can bind the standard ports.

Where a row isn't configured, **Fix (elevate)** runs the privileged action; once it *is* configured, **Revert** (Unelevate) undoes it, both behind an in-app confirm dialog and the OS prompt. Reverting the resolver restores your previous one on macOS; port revert is macOS-only.

See [Features](./desktop-app#doctor) for the rest of the GUI.

### When the daemon won't start

If the app fails to start the daemon, it shows a diagnostics panel with hints derived from the daemon's own logs plus the last few lines of the macOS self-repair trail (`orcker-gui-repair.log` - see [The Daemon](./daemon#autostart)). One case it recognizes: a running daemon whose config schema is newer than what the daemon build understands (an upgrade that didn't fully take effect) - the panel names it explicitly and suggests toggling the daemon's login item off then on in Settings to force re-registration, or removing any leftover old `Orcker.app` copies.

"Copy diagnostics" in that panel bundles the daemon log tail, the repair log tail, and the detected hints together, so a bug report carries everything in one paste.

## From the command line

::: tip
Add `--json` to either command for machine-readable output. Exit codes matter too: `orcker doctor` exits `1` on any hard failure, else `0`.
:::

### `orcker status`

A read-only snapshot, rendered as one block. No flags beyond the global `--json`.

```sh
orcker status
```

A healthy machine looks roughly like this:

```text
daemon    running (pid 4821, up 2h 13m, rss 6.2 MB)
version   2.0.2
tld       .test
http      80
https     443
dns       127.0.0.1:1053
ca        trusted: yes  (/Users/you/Library/Application Support/io.orcker.Orcker/ca/ca.cert.pem)
resolver  installed: yes
load      0.42 0.51 0.48
sites     3 parked, 1 linked, 2 secured

php
  8.5 (default)  running  pid 4830  /run/user/501/orcker/fpm-8.5.sock  rss 18.4 MB
  8.3            running  pid 4844  /run/user/501/orcker/fpm-8.3.sock  rss 17.1 MB
```

### What each line means

| Line | Notes |
|---|---|
| `daemon` | pid, uptime, RSS. The reverse proxy and DNS responder run inside the daemon, so one RSS figure covers all three. Omitted when it can't be read (non-Linux or transient failure). |
| `version` | The running daemon's version. Shows `unknown` for daemons that predate version reporting. |
| `tld` | The TLD served, e.g. `.test`. |
| `http` / `https` | The bound port. A privileged-port fallback shows `80 → 8080 (fallback)`; an active macOS redirect shows `80 → 8080 (redirected)`. Reachable on the requested port either way. When neither the privileged port nor its fallback could bind, the line instead reads `not serving - couldn't bind 8080 (run orcker doctor)` - the daemon is up but serving no sites. See `doctor`'s `WebPortsUnbound`. |
| `ports` (conflict) | Only shown when a **non-Orcker** process is holding 80/443. Orcker confirms the redirect actually reaches *its* proxy (via a `Server: orcker` marker), so a foreign web server or a stale `pf` rule is reported as a conflict rather than mistaken for a live redirect. Run `orcker doctor`. |
| `dns` | The address the embedded DNS responder is bound on, or `not resolving - couldn't bind port 1053 (run orcker doctor)` when something else already holds that port. This is a soft-fail: the daemon still runs (proxy, PHP pools, IPC), just without `.test` name resolution. See `doctor`'s `DnsPortUnbound`. |
| `ca` | `trusted: yes / no / unknown`, plus the CA cert path. `unknown` means the probe couldn't tell, and is not treated as untrusted. |
| `resolver` | Whether the OS resolver routes `*.<tld>` to Orcker. Tri-state (`yes` / `no` / `unknown`). |
| `load` | 1/5/15-minute load averages. Omitted where unavailable. |
| `sites` | Parked, linked, and secured (HTTPS) counts. |
| `php` | One line per installed version: state (`running` / `stopped` / `failed`), FPM master `pid`, listen socket, RSS, and `update→<patch>` when a newer patch exists. The default is marked `(default)`. |

::: info Why ports read "fallback"
Binding 80 and 443 needs elevation. Without it, the daemon falls back to rootless `8080`/`8443`. On macOS, `sudo orcker elevate ports` installs a packet-filter redirect so 80/443 still reach the rootless listener; `status` shows `(redirected)` and `doctor` treats it as satisfied. See [Elevation & Privileges](./elevation) and [HTTPS & Certificates](./https).

### `orcker doctor`

Runs the full set of checks and prints each finding with a severity mark, an explanation, and the fix command where applicable.

```sh
orcker doctor
```

```text
⚠ Local CA not trusted
    HTTPS sites will show certificate warnings until the CA is trusted.
    → sudo orcker elevate trust
✗ PHP-FPM pool failed
    The PHP 8.5 FPM pool is not running.
    → fixed automatically by `orcker doctor fix`, or restart with `orcker use 8.5`
```

When nothing is wrong:

```text
✓ All checks passed
    Daemon, ports, DNS, CA, and PHP look healthy.
```

#### Severities

| Mark | Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `✓` | `Ok` | Informational or healthy. Never affects the exit code. |
| `⚠` | `Warn` | A non-fatal problem worth addressing (e.g. CA not trusted). |
| `✗` | `Fail` | Breaks expected behaviour (e.g. no PHP, a dead pool). Any `Fail` exits `1`. |

#### What doctor checks

| Code | Severity | Meaning | Remedy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DaemonDown` | `Fail` | The CLI couldn't reach the daemon over IPC. | `orckerd` |
| `WebPortsUnbound` | `Fail` | Neither the privileged web ports nor their rootless fallback could bind (something else holds both) - the daemon is up but serving no sites. Supersedes `PortFallback`. | Free the ports, or change the fallback ports in Settings (Orcker ▸ General), then restart the daemon |
| `PortFallback` | `Warn` | A privileged port (below 1024) fell back to rootless and isn't reachable on the requested port. | `sudo orcker elevate ports` |
| `ForeignWebListener` | `Warn` | A process **other than Orcker** is listening on 80/443 (confirmed via the proxy's `Server` marker, so Orcker is never mistaken for the squatter). Cross-platform. Supersedes `PortFallback` - elevation can't bind a port someone else owns. | Stop the other web server, then `sudo orcker elevate ports` |
| `DnsPortUnbound` | `Warn` | The DNS port (`dns_port`) is held by another process. The daemon still runs, just without `*.test` resolution - independent of the web-port checks above, so it surfaces even alongside `WebPortsUnbound`. | Free that port, or change it in Settings (Orcker ▸ General), then restart. Re-run `sudo orcker elevate resolver` if the port changed |
| `CaNotTrusted` | `Warn` | The local CA isn't in the system trust store, so HTTPS shows warnings. | `sudo orcker elevate trust` |
| `PhpCaNotTrusted` | `Warn` | The bundled PHP's CA bundle (`cacert.pem`) is missing or stale, so PHP HTTPS to `.test` fails with cURL error 60. **Auto-fixable.** | `orcker doctor fix` (rebuilds the bundle; restart Orcker if it persists) |
| `ResolverNotInstalled` | `Warn` | The OS resolver doesn't route `*.<tld>` to Orcker's DNS. | `sudo orcker elevate resolver` |
| `NoPhpInstalled` | `Fail` | No PHP versions installed. | `orcker install php <default>` |
| `DefaultPhpNotInstalled` | `Fail` | The default PHP version isn't installed (others are). | `orcker install php <default>` |
| `FpmPoolFailed` | `Fail` | A supervised FPM master died. **Auto-fixable.** | `orcker doctor fix`, or `orcker use <version>` |
| `PhpUpdateAvailable` | `Ok` | A newer patch exists (notify-only; Orcker never updates silently). | `orcker update php <version>` |
| `ResolverBackupSaved` | `Ok` | Installing the resolver replaced a pre-existing `/etc/resolver/<tld>` (e.g. a Valet/Herd leftover); a timestamped backup was saved. `sudo orcker unelevate resolver` restores it automatically. | _(none)_ |
| `NoSites` | `Ok` | No sites configured yet. | `orcker park <dir>` or `orcker link <name> <dir>` |
| `DomainShadowed` | `Warn` | Two sites claim the same domain, so one was dropped from routing. Which site wins can depend on directory scan order, so it may change on restart (usually the result of a hand-edited config). | Make each site's domains unique with `orcker domain remove` or `orcker domain primary` |
| `ServiceOverrideInvalid` | `Warn` | A line in a service's hand-edited `conf.d/50-local.<ext>` file names a directive Orcker manages itself, or reads as no directive at all. One finding per bad line, naming the file and line number. | Edit the file (Orcker never rewrites it), then `orcker service restart <SVC>` |
| `AllGood` | `Ok` | Nothing else is wrong. | _(none)_ |

::: tip No false alarms
Several probes are tri-state. CA trust and resolver installation are flagged only when the daemon is certain they're absent; an `unknown` result stays silent. Likewise, `NoPhpInstalled` suppresses `DefaultPhpNotInstalled`, an active macOS port redirect suppresses `PortFallback`, and a `ForeignWebListener` conflict also suppresses `PortFallback` (the foreign-process warning is the accurate, actionable finding - elevating won't help while another process owns the port).
:::

### `orcker doctor fix`

Performs the safe, unprivileged repairs, then re-diagnoses and lists whatever still needs you.

```sh
orcker doctor fix
```

```text
applied fixes:
  ✓ restarted PHP 8.5 FPM pool

still needs attention:
  ⚠ Local CA not trusted
      → sudo orcker elevate trust
```

If nothing was auto-fixable:

```text
no automatic fixes were applicable
```

#### Auto-fixes are safe-only

`doctor fix` only applies fast, idempotent, unprivileged repairs on its own: **restarting a failed PHP-FPM pool**, and **rebuilding the bundled PHP's CA bundle** (`cacert.pem`) when it's missing or stale. Everything privileged or consequential is left for you to run, surfaced under "still needs attention" with the exact command:

- Trusting the CA (`sudo orcker elevate trust`)
- Installing the DNS resolver (`sudo orcker elevate resolver`)
- Granting the port capability / redirect (`sudo orcker elevate ports`)
- Installing or updating PHP (`orcker install php …`, `orcker update php …`)

::: warning
`orcker doctor fix` will not run `sudo` for you. Privileged fixes always require you to run the suggested `sudo orcker elevate …` command yourself. See [Elevation & Privileges](./elevation).
:::

#### How fix works

```text
1. daemon builds a StatusReport
2. plan_auto_fixes(report)  ->  failed FPM pools become RestartFpm; a stale PHP CA bundle becomes RebuildPhpCaBundle
3. daemon performs each restart, recording success/failure  ->  "applied fixes"
4. daemon re-builds a fresh StatusReport and re-diagnoses
5. remaining Warn/Fail findings  ->  "still needs attention"
```

Step 4 re-diagnoses against the post-fix world, so a successfully restarted pool won't reappear; a failed restart shows `✗` under "applied fixes" and the finding persists. The exit code follows that remainder: `1` only if a `Fail` still stands.

### Putting it together

A typical troubleshooting loop:

```sh
orcker status          # what's the daemon doing now?
orcker doctor          # what's wrong and how do I fix it?
orcker doctor fix      # repair the safe stuff
sudo orcker elevate trust   # run any privileged command doctor surfaced
orcker doctor          # confirm everything is green
```
