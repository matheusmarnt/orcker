# Sites

A **site** is a target Orcker serves on the `.test` TLD. Each one has a name, a document root, a **served web root** (auto-detected per framework), a PHP version, and an HTTPS flag. The daemon keeps a registry and resolves every request's `Host:` header to exactly one site.

You register sites two ways:

- **Parking** points Orcker at a *parent* directory, and every child folder becomes a site (`<folder>.test`). Good for a `~/Sites` workspace you add to often.
- **Linking** registers *one* directory under a name you choose. Good for a project outside your parked workspace, or when the site name shouldn't match the folder name.

Both route identically; only the registration differs.

## In the desktop app

The **Sites** page (under **Environment** in the sidebar) is the home base for managing your sites. It lists every `.test` site as a scannable card you can act on, with the registration controls in the header. Most day-to-day site work happens here without touching the terminal.

<ThemedImage light="/images/sites-light.png" dark="/images/sites-dark.png" alt="The Sites page in the Orcker desktop app" />

- Each card is a site you can click to open in your browser (at its primary domain), with badges for `parked`/`linked`, PHP version, HTTPS/HTTP, a `+N` badge when the site has extra domains, and an amber notice if another site has claimed its apex.
- A card's **Edit…** dialog (from its `⋯` menu) covers PHP version, [web root](#web-root-the-served-directory), HTTPS, and [group](#site-groups) in one place - no commands. The same `⋯` menu has **Manage domains…** for setting the primary domain and adding/removing aliases and wildcards.
- **Park folder** and **Link site** in the header register new sites: Park folder opens a directory picker, Link site opens a modal to name a single directory.
- A separate **Parked folders** section lists each parked root with a count of the sites it produces, plus Reveal folder and Un-park.

For the full tour of the app, see [Features](./desktop-app#sites).

### Site groups

Sites can be organised into named groups - a GUI-only, cosmetic layer for scanning a large site list (client work, personal projects, whatever grouping makes sense to you). Groups don't affect routing, PHP, or HTTPS; the CLI has no concept of them.

- **Create a group** from the header's **⋯** menu → **New group…**. The page still shows the classic flat grid until at least one group exists; once it does, sites render as collapsible group sections instead.
- **Assign a site to a group** from its **Edit…** dialog: a **Group** field lists the groups you've created plus **No group**. A site only shows up in a group once you've set this.
- **Reorder groups** with the up/down arrows next to a group's name (shown on hover).
- **Rename or delete a group** from the pencil icon next to it, which opens one **Edit group** dialog: change the name and **Save**, or click **Delete group** for a second confirmation step naming the group. Deleting a group doesn't remove its sites - they fall back to Unallocated.
- Each group is a **collapsible section** with a site count badge; collapsed/expanded state is remembered per group.
- Sites with no group assigned - or whose assigned group was deleted - appear in a synthetic **Unallocated** section at the end, with no management controls of its own.

<ThemedImage light="/images/edit-site-light.png" dark="/images/edit-site-dark.png" alt="The Edit site dialog, with PHP version, web root, HTTPS, and Group fields" />

Group names are unique case-insensitively (like site names) and can't be `Unallocated`, which is reserved for the synthetic bucket.

## Create a new Laravel site

Beyond registering folders you already have, the app can **scaffold a brand-new Laravel project** for you. Open the **Create** menu in the Sites header and choose **New Laravel site** to launch a short, four-step wizard - **Basics → Stack → Testing → Review** - that runs `laravel new` under the PHP version you pick and registers the result as a `.test` site automatically.

::: tip Prerequisites
Creating a Laravel site needs a PHP version, **Composer**, and the **Laravel installer**. If any are missing, the wizard offers to install them first; it can also use ones you already have [installed externally](./tooling#external-tools) (e.g. a global Composer). Starter kits that need Node or Bun pull the runtime in during the build.
:::

### Basics

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-laravel-1-light.png" dark="/images/create-laravel-1-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-Laravel-site wizard, Basics step" />

- **Project name** - the site is served at `<name>.test`.
- **Location** - pick the parent folder. If it's a [parked](#parking-a-directory) root the new site is served automatically; any other folder is [linked](#linking-a-directory) under the project name.
- **PHP version** - the version the site (and the installer) runs on.
- **HTTPS** - serve it over TLS from day one (you can toggle this later too).

### Stack

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-laravel-2-light.png" dark="/images/create-laravel-2-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-Laravel-site wizard, Stack step (starter kit)" />

Choose a **starter kit**: **None** (a plain skeleton, no auth scaffolding), the official **React**, **Vue**, or **Svelte** kits (Inertia + TypeScript), **Livewire** (Blade + PHP), or **Community…** to scaffold from any `--using <package>`.

### Testing

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-laravel-3-light.png" dark="/images/create-laravel-3-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-Laravel-site wizard, Testing step" />

- **Testing framework** - **Pest** or **PHPUnit**.
- **Database** - SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
- **Initialise git** - run `git init` in the new project.
- **Laravel Boost** - install [Boost](https://laravel.com/docs) for AI-assisted coding.

### Review

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-laravel-4-light.png" dark="/images/create-laravel-4-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-Laravel-site wizard, Review step" />

A final summary of your choices - site name, path, PHP version, and HTTPS. Click **Create** and the dialog switches to a live progress view (**Preflight → Scaffolding → Registering → Done**) streaming the installer's output, so you can watch the scaffold and dependency install happen.

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-laravel-5-light.png" dark="/images/create-laravel-5-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-Laravel-site wizard, live progress view" />

When it finishes, the project is on disk, registered (parked or linked), served at `<name>.test`, and ready to open in your browser or reveal in your file manager - no extra steps.

## Create a new WordPress site

The same **Create** menu can scaffold a brand-new WordPress install for you. Choose **New WordPress site** to launch a four-step wizard - **Basics → WordPress → Database → Review** - that provisions a database, runs WP-CLI's `core download`/`config create`/`core install`, sets pretty permalinks, and registers the result as a `.test` site automatically.

::: tip Prerequisites
Creating a WordPress site needs a PHP version and **WP-CLI**, and the wizard offers to install whatever's missing. WP-CLI must be Orcker's own build - Orcker runs it directly rather than through a `wp` on your `PATH`, so an [externally installed](./tooling#external-tools) `wp` doesn't count and your own copy is left alone. Orcker's **Composer** builds WP-CLI, so it's offered as a prerequisite too when WP-CLI still needs installing - see [Tooling](./tooling).
:::

### Basics

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-wordpress-1-light.png" dark="/images/create-wordpress-1-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-WordPress-site wizard, Basics step" />

- **Project name** - the site is served at `<name>.test`.
- **Location** - pick the parent folder. If it's a [parked](#parking-a-directory) root the new site is served automatically; any other folder is [linked](#linking-a-directory) under the project name.
- **PHP version** - the version the site (and WP-CLI) runs on.
- **HTTPS** - serve it over TLS from day one (you can toggle this later too).

### WordPress

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-wordpress-2-light.png" dark="/images/create-wordpress-2-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-WordPress-site wizard, WordPress step" />

- **Core version** - a specific WordPress release, or **Latest**.
- **Locale** - the install language (e.g. `en_US`, `en_GB`).
- **Site title** - WordPress's own site name, set at install time.
- **Admin username / email / password** - the first administrator account. **Generate** fills in a random password; the daemon re-validates all three server-side regardless of what the wizard sent.

### Database

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-wordpress-3-light.png" dark="/images/create-wordpress-3-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-WordPress-site wizard, Database step" />

- **Database engine** - **MySQL** or **MariaDB** (the only two WordPress core itself supports).
- **Database name** and **table prefix** - defaults are derived from the project name; both can be edited.

Orcker provisions the database as part of creating the site, installing/starting the chosen engine first if it isn't already running - see [Services & Databases](./services).

### Review

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-wordpress-4-light.png" dark="/images/create-wordpress-4-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-WordPress-site wizard, Review step" />

A final summary of your choices. Click **Create** and the dialog switches to a live progress view streaming each phase - **Preflight → Provisioning database → Downloading WordPress → Configuring → Installing → Registering → Done**.

<ThemedImage light="/images/create-wordpress-5-light.png" dark="/images/create-wordpress-5-dark.png" alt="The Create-a-new-WordPress-site wizard, live progress view" />

When it finishes, the site is on disk, registered, served at `<name>.test`, and ready to use - **Open folder**, **Open in browser**, or **WP Admin** to sign in as the administrator you just created (see below).

## WordPress one-click admin login

A WordPress site created through the wizard has **one-click admin login** turned on by default: opening **WP Admin** signs you in as the site's administrator instead of showing WordPress's own login screen. Existing or parked WordPress sites can opt in the same way.

<ThemedImage light="/images/edit-site-wordpress-light.png" dark="/images/edit-site-wordpress-dark.png" alt="The Edit site dialog for a WordPress site, with the WordPress Auto Admin Login toggle and Sign in as picker" />

- A WordPress site's card shows a **WP Admin** action in its `⋯` menu, plus a **WPA** badge when one-click login is on - both open the site's `/wp-admin/` pre-authenticated.
- Turn it on or off, and choose **who** to sign in as, from the site's **Edit…** dialog: the **WordPress Auto Admin Login** toggle and a **Sign in as** picker (defaults to the earliest-created administrator).

::: info How it works
Opening **WP Admin** mints a short-lived, single-use login token and appends it to the `/wp-admin/` URL. The proxy recognises and consumes the token on the first request, signing you in before redirecting - it's never valid a second time, and it does nothing outside that one request. If the resolver is off ([Localhost Access](./localhost-access)) or minting fails for any reason, **WP Admin** falls back to WordPress's ordinary login screen instead.
:::

## From the command line

Everything the Sites page does maps to a `orcker` command. These are the same operations against the same daemon, so anything you do here shows up in the app immediately.

### Parking a directory

`orcker park <dir>` registers a directory as a **parked root**. Each immediate child directory becomes a site named after the folder:

```sh
orcker park ~/Sites
#   ~/Sites/blog      ->  http://blog.test
#   ~/Sites/shop      ->  http://shop.test
#   ~/Sites/my-app    ->  http://my-app.test
```

Add a folder and its site is live; delete it and the site disappears. The child folder is the document root.

::: tip
You can park multiple roots. They all contribute children to one flat namespace of `.test` names.
:::

To stop serving a parked root, un-park it. This removes only the parked root, not any linked sites:

```sh
orcker unpark ~/Sites
```

Un-parking matches the stored path exactly. List the parked roots first if you're unsure what was registered:

```sh
orcker list parked
```

::: info
`orcker list parked` shows every parked root, including empty ones. An empty root produces no sites, so it won't appear in `orcker sites`, but it's still parked.
:::

### Linking a directory

`orcker link <name> <dir>` registers a single directory as a named site. The name becomes `<name>.test`; the directory is its document root:

```sh
orcker link my-app ~/code/my-app
#   ->  http://my-app.test
```

Name and directory are both optional shorthand for the current directory:

```sh
cd ~/code/my-app

orcker link              # links the cwd, named "my-app" after its folder
orcker link my-app       # same, with an explicit name
orcker link ../other-app # links a relative path, named "other-app" after its folder
```

A single positional argument is treated as a directory (and the name derived from its
folder) when it contains a path separator or is `.`/`..`; otherwise it's treated as a
bare name and the current directory is linked. Web-root detection (`public/` for
Laravel, etc. - see [Web root](#web-root-the-served-directory)) runs automatically the
first time a site is linked, so a Laravel app's `SERVED` directory is usually already
correct with no extra `orcker root` step.

To remove it, unlink by name:

```sh
orcker unlink my-app
```

### Site name rules

A site name is a single DNS label, validated and lowercased before it reaches the daemon (a bad name fails as a usage error, no connection made):

- ASCII letters, digits, and hyphen only (`[a-z0-9-]`).
- No dots; a name is one label, not a domain.
- No leading or trailing hyphen.
- 1-63 characters.
- Case-insensitive: `My-App` is stored and served as `my-app`.

Valid: `my-app`, `api2`, `wp-site`. Invalid: `my.app`, `my_app`, `-app`, `app-`.

::: warning
Names are unique. Since they're lowercased first, `Foo` and `foo` collide, so the second registration is a duplicate.
:::

### Listing your sites

`orcker sites` lists every site (parked and linked) with its kind, PHP version, secure flag, served subdirectory, and document root:

```sh
orcker sites
```

```
NAME     KIND     PHP   SECURE   SERVED   DOCROOT
blog     parked   8.5   false    public   /Users/you/Sites/blog
my-app   linked   8.3   true     /        /Users/you/code/my-app
shop     parked   8.5   false    public   /Users/you/Sites/shop
```

The `SERVED` column is the web root relative to the document root; `/` means the project root itself is served.

Sites print in name order; an empty registry prints `no sites`. Add `--json` for machine-readable output:

```sh
orcker sites --json
```

## How routing works

Orcker normalises the `Host:` header and resolves it to a site using the rules below.

### The `.test` TLD

By default Orcker serves on `.test`, a reserved TLD that's safe for local development. A host only resolves if it ends in the configured TLD:

```
blog.test        ->  site "blog"
blog.example     ->  no match (wrong TLD)
blog.notthetest  ->  no match (suffix collision doesn't count)
```

The bare TLD (`test`, or `test.`) has no site label and never resolves.

::: info
The TLD is configurable (for example `dev.local`); the default is `.test`, and `orcker status` shows the active one. See [DNS &amp; .test Domains](./dns) for how `*.test` requests reach the daemon.
:::

### Host cleanup

Matching is case-insensitive and tolerant of cosmetic bits clients send. Before matching, Orcker:

- Lowercases the host (`FOO.TEST` matches `foo`).
- Strips a port (`foo.test:8443` becomes `foo.test`; a trailing `:` is fine).
- Strips one trailing FQDN dot (`foo.test.` becomes `foo.test`).

Hosts that can't be a `.test` name never match: IPv6 literals (`[::1]`), non-ASCII (`föö.test`), an empty host, a leading dot, or a malformed port (`foo.test:abc`).

### Domains, subdomains, and wildcards

By default a site answers for **exactly one** host: its apex `<name>.test`. A site can hold more than one domain, and can answer subdomains and wildcards, but each is **explicit** - you register it with [`orcker domain`](../reference/cli/domains). After confirming the host ends in `.test`, Orcker resolves it with one exact lookup, then one single-label wildcard lookup:

```text
foo.test          ->  foo            (exact apex)
corp.test         ->  foo            (only if `corp` was added to foo)
api.foo.test      ->  no match       (404 by default; subdomains are not implicit)
api.foo.test      ->  foo            (once `*.foo.test` is added to foo)
x.api.foo.test    ->  no match       (a wildcard matches one label; needs `*.api.foo.test`)
```

**This changed in v2.** Earlier builds made every subdomain fall through to its parent site implicitly. That catch-all is gone: `api.foo.test` is a 404 until you register it. Re-enable the old behavior for a site with `orcker domain add foo '*.foo.test'`. The upside is that `foo.test` and `*.foo.test` can now be **two different sites**.

**Exact beats wildcard.** The exact lookup runs first, so a registered `api.foo.test` (exact) wins over a `*.foo.test` wildcard on another site. A wildcard is never a site's primary (canonical) domain - only exact domains can be primary.

Manage a site's domains from the CLI:

```sh
orcker domain list blog                  # show blog's domains, primary marked
orcker domain add blog corp.test         # add an alias
orcker domain add blog '*.blog.test'     # add a wildcard (quote it for the shell)
orcker domain primary blog corp.test     # make corp.test the canonical address
orcker domain remove blog blog.test      # drop a domain (a site keeps >=1 exact)
orcker domain reset blog                 # back to the default apex only
```

For a WordPress site, changing the primary domain also rewrites its `siteurl`/`home`. In the desktop app the same lives under a site's **⋯ → Manage domains…**. See the [domains reference](../reference/cli/domains) for the full command surface and rules.

### Document roots and the served web root

The **document root** is the project directory a site maps to: the child folder for a parked site, or the path you passed to `orcker link`. It's shown in `orcker sites`.

The directory actually served to the browser is the document root's **web root** - which, for most modern frameworks, is a subdirectory rather than the project root itself. Orcker detects this automatically (see [Web root](#web-root-the-served-directory) below), so a Laravel app parked at `~/Sites/blog` is served from `~/Sites/blog/public` without any configuration.

### The secure (HTTPS) flag

Sites start insecure (HTTP only). Securing one serves it over HTTPS with a certificate from Orcker's local CA:

```sh
orcker secure my-app      # serve over HTTPS
orcker unsecure my-app    # back to HTTP only
```

::: tip
`orcker secure` promotes a parked site to a tracked (linked) entry so the flag has somewhere to live, then flips it. See [HTTPS &amp; Certificates](./https) for how the CA and per-site certificates work.
:::

## Web root (the served directory)

Most PHP frameworks don't serve from the project root - they put a front controller in a subdirectory and keep application code out of the document root. Orcker detects the right directory automatically and serves it, so you don't hand-configure a web server:

| Framework | Served from |
|---|---|
| Laravel, Symfony (4+), CodeIgniter 4 | `public/` |
| CakePHP | `webroot/` |
| Drupal (Composer), Yii2 | `web/` |
| Magento 2 | `pub/` |
| WordPress, plain PHP | the project root |

Detection runs in the daemon when a site is registered and whenever its project changes - it reads `composer.json`, looks for framework marker files (`artisan`, `wp-config.php`, `bin/console`, …), and probes for a front controller (`index.php`) in the conventional subdirectories. A site with nothing to detect yet (an empty folder) serves the project root for now, and Orcker watches it so that **cloning a project into a parked folder makes it serve from the right directory within a second or so - no restart, no refresh**.

The served path shows up in `orcker sites` (the `SERVED` column, `/` meaning the project root itself).

::: info Static files are served directly
A request that resolves to a real file under the served root (a stylesheet, image, `favicon.ico`, compiled JS, …) is returned straight from disk by the proxy, with a guessed `Content-Type` - it never touches PHP. A directory request (including the site root) falls back to `index.html` or `index.htm` from that directory when there's no `index.php` there, so a plain static site (no PHP at all) works with no extra configuration. Everything else is handed to the framework's front controller (`index.php`). PHP source files are never served as static bytes. A symlink is allowed to point anywhere inside the site's project directory - so Laravel's `public/storage -> ../storage/app/public` link works with no extra setup - but a symlink that escapes the project directory entirely is refused with an explicit `403 Forbidden` naming the requested path, rather than being silently handed to PHP.
:::

::: info Directory requests get a trailing-slash redirect
On a site running in **direct** mode - front controller off, where named `.php` files are executable by URL - a `GET /sub` naming a real directory answers `301` to `/sub/`, exactly as Apache's `DirectorySlash` and nginx's `try_files $uri $uri/` do. The slashed form is then resolved normally: `sub/index.php` if it has one, otherwise `sub/index.html`. This is what makes a legacy multi-directory PHP app work - without it, `/sub` fell through to the *root* `index.php`, and an app whose root script redirects into the subdirectory looped until the browser gave up.

Front-controller sites are deliberately unaffected: there, `/sub` is a framework route, not a directory. The redirect is also limited to `GET` and `HEAD`, so a `POST` is never redirected.
:::

### Overriding the served path

When detection guesses wrong, or you have an unconventional layout, set the served directory explicitly:

```sh
orcker root my-app public      # serve my-app.test from <docroot>/public
orcker root my-app web/app     # a nested directory is fine
orcker root my-app --auto      # forget the override; go back to auto-detection
```

`orcker root <site>` with no path also resets to auto-detection. The path is relative to the site's directory (an absolute path inside it works too); Orcker validates that it resolves to a directory **inside** the project and rejects anything that escapes it. A manual override always wins and is never overwritten by re-detection.

::: tip In the desktop app
The [Sites view](./desktop-app#sites) shows the served web root as a badge per site, and its **Edit…** dialog sets it directly - leave the field blank to go back to auto-detection.
:::

## Routing rules

Detection and the web root cover the common layouts, but two shapes need a rule.

A **legacy portal with a nested app** - an older PHP site that grew a Yii or CodeIgniter API in a subdirectory - has *two* front controllers, and only the root one is found automatically. A rule points the rest at the nested one:

```sh
orcker route add portal /api api/index.php
# portal.test/api/user/login  → api/index.php (POST included)
# portal.test/anything-else   → the root index.php
```

A **JavaScript SPA** needs history-API deep links to serve the app shell:

```sh
orcker route add dashboard / index.html
# dashboard.test/settings/profile → index.html
```

A rule only applies when the request matched no real file, so assets and real directories keep winning. A site whose web root holds an `index.html` and no `index.php` gets the SPA behaviour automatically, with no rule at all.

See [Routing rules](../reference/cli/routes) for the full semantics, and note this is different from a [reverse proxy path rule](./proxies), which forwards to a separate running service rather than to a file inside the site.

## Streaming responses (SSE / Livewire `wire:stream`)

Streamed responses pass straight through as PHP flushes them - server-sent events, `response()->stream()`, Livewire's `wire:stream`, and token-by-token AI output all reach the browser incrementally. There is no setting to turn on and no header to send: `X-Accel-Buffering: no` is unnecessary (Orcker consumes it rather than forwarding it), and a response that sets no `Content-Length` is sent chunked.

Each open stream occupies one PHP-FPM worker for as long as it stays open, so a page holding several event streams, or a few tabs left open on one, can reach the per-version ceiling of 16 workers and leave later requests queueing. Raise it with [`orcker php pool`](./php-versions#pool-size) if you work with streaming regularly.

If a stream still arrives in one burst, the buffering is on the application side. Check `output_buffering` and any `ob_*` handlers your framework installs, and `zlib.output_compression`, which buffers to compress:

```php
while (ob_get_level() > 0) {
    ob_end_flush();
}
flush();
```
