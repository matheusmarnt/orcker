# What is Orcker?

Orcker is a fast, rootless, open-source local PHP development environment. It serves your projects on `.test` domains over HTTP and HTTPS, runs a different PHP version per site, and manages everything from one small background daemon. No Docker, no `sudo` for daily work, no subscription.

If you've used [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com), you know the appeal: open `https://my-app.test` and it just works - the right PHP version, a trusted certificate, no fuss. Orcker does the same, on macOS and Linux, and it's fully open-source.

## Why Orcker?

Setting up local PHP the traditional way means stitching together a web server, a DNS tool, a certificate workflow, and some way to juggle PHP versions. Docker hides the wiring but trades it for image pulls and a VM you didn't want. Orcker gives you the same result as plain, native processes:

- **Zero-config sites.** Drop a project into a parked folder and it's instantly live at `<name>.test` - no config files, no virtual hosts. [Sites →](./sites)
- **HTTPS that just works.** Orcker issues a trusted certificate for every site on demand: a green padlock, no browser warnings, no `mkcert` dance. [HTTPS →](./https)
- **Any PHP version, per site.** Install as many versions as you need and point each project at the one it wants. [PHP versions →](./php-versions)
- **Rootless by design.** After a single one-time setup, nothing runs as administrator - the daemon, CLI, and app all run as you. [Elevation →](./elevation)
- **Tiny and native.** One small daemon (~8 MB), no containers, no VM, no Electron. PHP builds download only when you ask.
- **Batteries included.** Databases and caches (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis), mail capture, live Laravel dump streaming, and one-click public [sharing](./sharing) over Cloudflare Tunnel are built in - not bolt-ons.
- **Self-diagnosing.** Built-in health checks show what's wrong and repair the safe problems for you. [Diagnostics →](./diagnostics)

## One tool, two ways to drive it

Under the hood Orcker is a single background daemon that owns everything - your sites, PHP, HTTPS, and DNS. You drive it however you like:

- the **[desktop app](./desktop-app)** - a native tray app (shown above), or
- the **[`orcker` command line](../reference/cli/)** - first-class and fully scriptable.

Both are just clients of the same daemon, so a change in one shows up in the other immediately - they can never disagree about what's running.

## How it works

When you open `https://my-app.test`:

1. Orcker's built-in DNS answers `*.test` with your own machine (`127.0.0.1`).
2. Its reverse proxy matches the address to a site and hands the request to the right PHP version.
3. For secured sites it serves HTTPS using a certificate from Orcker's own local certificate authority - trusted once, valid everywhere.

That's the whole path, and it all lives inside the one daemon. Curious about the internals? See the [Architecture](../developer/architecture) overview.

## A quick taste

```sh
orcker install php 8.5          # grab a PHP version
orcker park ~/Sites             # serve every project in a folder
orcker secure my-app            # turn on trusted HTTPS
# open https://my-app.test - done
```

The [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide walks through it from a clean machine.

## Who Orcker is for

- **PHP and Laravel developers** who want Herd-style `.test` sites and trusted HTTPS on macOS or Linux.
- **Anyone juggling multiple PHP versions** who needs a specific one per project.
- **People who'd rather not run Docker** for local dev and prefer light, native processes.
- **Open-source-minded developers** who want a tool they can read, audit, and contribute to.
