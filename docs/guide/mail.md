# Mail Capture

Orcker ships a built-in **mail-capture SMTP server** - a local sink that catches
every email your apps "send" and keeps it for you to inspect, Herd-style. Point
your app's mailer at it and password resets, order confirmations, and queued
notifications land in Orcker instead of a real inbox. Nothing is ever relayed:
**captured mail never leaves your machine**.

It's the local-dev counterpart to Mailpit / MailHog / Mailtrap, except there's
nothing to install or run - it's part of the [`orckerd` daemon](./daemon) that
already runs your sites, PHP, HTTPS, and DNS.

## In the desktop app

<ThemedImage light="/images/mail-light.png" dark="/images/mail-dark.png" alt="The Mail page in the Orcker desktop app" />

The [desktop app](./desktop-app) surfaces mail capture on its own **Mail** page,
under the **Developer** group in the sidebar. It's the richest way to drive
capture and read what's been caught.

- The page shows the current **capture status** and the **port** the SMTP
  listener is bound to.
- An **enable toggle** turns capture on or off, and a **port** field changes the
  listening port (both take effect on the next daemon restart).
- **Show Mails** pops out the separate **Mails** viewer window, which renders
  HTML bodies (including inline images) in a sandboxed frame so you can keep
  captured mail next to your editor and browser.
- A **Laravel configuration** card emits the `.env` mail keys (`MAIL_HOST`,
  `MAIL_PORT`, …) ready to paste into your app, with an editable From name and
  address.

Captured mail is tracked as **read or unread**. New messages count toward an
unread badge that shows in three places: a pill on the sidebar **Mail** item
(click it to open the viewer), an orange dot on the tray icon, and a **Mail (N)**
label in the tray menu. Clicking a message in the Mails viewer marks it read, and
unread messages are highlighted in the list - the message the viewer auto-selects
on open stays unread until you click it - so the badge always reflects what you
haven't looked at yet.

## From the command line

```sh
# Mail capture is already on (loopback SMTP on 127.0.0.1:2525).
# Point your app's mailer at it, send a mail, then:

orcker mail list          # newest-first table of captured emails
orcker mail show 000003   # one email's headers + body
orcker mail clear         # delete everything captured so far
```

## On by default

Mail capture is **enabled by default**. The daemon binds a tiny SMTP listener on
`127.0.0.1:2525` (the `DEFAULT_MAIL_PORT`) at startup - no setup, no elevation, no
`.test` resolution required. It speaks just enough SMTP for a dev mailer (`EHLO`,
`MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, `DATA`, `QUIT`); there is **no AUTH and no TLS**, and every
recipient is accepted.

::: info Local only, never relayed
The server is a *sink*, not a relay. A captured message is written to disk and
surfaced for inspection - it is never forwarded to a real mail server, so you can
exercise your app's email flows with zero risk of a stray message reaching a real
person.
:::

::: tip Bind failure is non-fatal
If port `2525` is already in use (another capture tool, say), the daemon logs a
warning and runs with capture *not listening* - your sites are never taken down by
a busy mail port. `orcker status` reports whether the listener actually bound.
:::

## Pointing an app at Orcker

Configure your app's mailer to talk plain SMTP to `127.0.0.1:2525` with no
authentication and no encryption. For a Laravel app, that's a four-line change to
`.env`:

```ini
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
# No MAIL_USERNAME / MAIL_PASSWORD - the capture server has no auth.
```

Send a mail (a password reset, `php artisan tinker` + `Mail::raw(...)`, a queued
job) and it's captured immediately. Any framework or language works the same way -
anything that can send SMTP to a loopback port with no auth and no TLS.

::: warning Don't point production at it
This is a development convenience with no authentication and no transport
security. It binds loopback only and is not meant to be reachable from a network.
Keep these settings to your local `.env`.
:::

## Reading captured mail from the CLI

Three subcommands cover the common loop. See the
[Mail CLI reference](../reference/cli/mail) for the precise output shapes.

```sh
orcker mail list
# ID      FROM                        SUBJECT
# 000003  Example <hi@example.com>    Password Reset
# 000002  shop@acme.test              Your order shipped
# 000001  no-reply@acme.test          Welcome
```

`orcker mail list` prints a newest-first table of `ID`, `FROM`, and `SUBJECT`. Pass
an id to `orcker mail show` to read one message:

```sh
orcker mail show 000003
# From:    Example <hi@example.com>
# To:      you@app.test
# Subject: Password Reset
#
# Your OTP is 416063.
```

`show` prints the headers and the **text body**. A message that carries only an
HTML body (no plain-text part) shows a short note pointing you at the GUI viewer,
which can render it. `orcker mail clear` deletes every captured email.

::: tip Machine-readable output
Like every `orcker` command, the mail commands accept the global `--json` flag for
scripting: `orcker mail list --json` emits the captured-email metadata as JSON, and
`orcker mail show <id> --json` emits the full decoded message (headers and both
bodies).
:::

## The viewer

The standalone **Mails** viewer window - opened from the [desktop app](./desktop-app)
with **Show Mails** - decodes each message for you: headers, the plain-text body,
and a rendered **HTML** body. From the GUI you can read, delete individual
messages, clear everything, open **file attachments**, and follow **http(s) /
mailto / tel** links in both HTML and plain-text bodies (they open in your OS
browser / handler).

<ThemedImage light="/images/mails-light.png" dark="/images/mails-dark.png" alt="A captured email open in the Orcker Mails viewer" />

The HTML body is sanitized with **DOMPurify** and rendered in a **Shadow DOM**
in the Mails window (so link clicks work reliably on macOS WKWebView). Openable
`http(s)` / `mailto` / `tel` links are stamped and opened via the OS browser /
handler. Inline images referenced by `cid:` are embedded as `data:` URLs.
Remote images and stylesheets (e.g. a logo served over `https://`) are **blocked
by default** so merely opening a message cannot phone home. The right sidebar
lists those URLs under **Remote content**; use **Load remote content** when you
want them. Non-inline attachments appear in a bar under the body and open with
the OS default app.

## Configuration

Mail-capture settings live in your [config file](../reference/configuration) under
a `[mail]` table:

```toml
[mail]
enabled = true
port = 2525
```

Both keys default (enabled, port `2525`), so a config written before mail capture
existed still works - and a default install emits no `[mail]` table at all. You
normally don't hand-edit this; drive it through the [desktop app](./desktop-app),
which keeps the config in sync.

::: warning Changes apply on the next daemon restart
Changing the port or toggling capture on/off is saved immediately but takes effect
on the **next daemon start/restart** - there's no hot rebind. Run
`orcker restart daemon` to apply a change right away.
:::

Captured mail is stored under the daemon's data directory at `<data>/mail`, one
`.eml` file per message plus an `index.json` metadata cache. The store keeps a
bounded number of recent messages (the oldest are evicted past the cap) and is
always available - already-captured mail stays listable and clearable even when
capture is turned off.
