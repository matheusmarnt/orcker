# Features

Orcker is a fast, rootless, open-source local PHP environment for macOS and Linux. It serves projects on `.test` domains over HTTP and HTTPS, runs a different PHP version per site, and manages it all from one small daemon. No Docker, no `sudo` for daily work, no subscription.

The **desktop app** is the recommended way to run all of it: a small tray-first window over everything the CLI does. Built with Tauri v2, Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind, it's a thin client of the [daemon](./daemon), just like the `orcker` CLI - every button maps to one IPC request to `orckerd`, so the GUI and CLI can't drift out of sync. This page is a tour of everything it can do, screen by screen; each section links to the full guide for that feature.

If you live in the terminal, the [CLI](../reference/cli/) is a first-class alternative. Not installed yet? See [Getting Started](./getting-started).

## The window at a glance

The sidebar opens on **Overview** and groups the rest:

| Group | Pages |
| --- | --- |
| General | **Overview** - a live dashboard of what's running · **About** |
| Environment | **Sites** · **PHP** · **Services** |
| Developer | **Tooling** · **Proxies** · **Mail** · **Dumps** |
| Integrations | **Share** - publish a site over a public URL ([guide](./sharing)) |
| System | **Settings** · **Doctor** |

### Overview

<ThemedImage light="/images/overview-light.png" dark="/images/overview-dark.png" alt="Overview dashboard" />

The landing dashboard. With the daemon running it shows a **serving** summary - the number of live `.test` sites (each a clickable chip that opens in your browser), stat tiles for PHP versions, sites, services, and captured mail (each links to its page), and a **system-health** strip (Local CA, `.test` resolver, privileged ports). When the daemon is down, the same surface becomes a **Start Orcker** hero. While the daemon is running, this page polls it every 5 seconds, so a change made from the CLI or another window shows up without a manual refresh.

### Settings

<ThemedImage light="/images/settings-light.png" dark="/images/settings-dark.png" alt="Settings page" />

App- and daemon-level settings (one of the pages that stays usable when the daemon is down, since it can start or install it):

- **Daemon.** Whether `orckerd` is running (with pid), a Start or Stop button, and a list of the daemon's in-process subsystems - the DNS resolver, the HTTP and HTTPS proxy listeners (with bound ports, including when macOS's `pf` redirect carries `:80`/`:443`), **Mail capture** (by port), and **Dump capture** (by port). The daemon row has a Restart button. Start/Stop/Restart go through your per-user service manager (systemd `--user` on Linux, a launchd LaunchAgent on macOS), with a detached-process fallback where none exists; the same actions are in the tray menu.
- **Application Ports** (while the daemon is running). Editable HTTP/HTTPS (the rootless fallback ports used when 80/443 need elevation), DNS, mail-capture, and dumps ports. If a port is in use elsewhere the page flags it here (site serving or `.test` resolution shows as unbound) so you can pick a free one. Change a value and **Save & restart** validates it, saves, restarts the daemon, and rechecks. HTTP/HTTPS are locked while ports are elevated - un-elevate them on the Doctor page first.
- **Start at login.** Three toggles - start the daemon at login, start the app at login, and start the app minimized (hidden to the tray). The daemon-at-login toggle is disabled where no per-user service manager is available.
- **Terminal CLI** (macOS and Linux). Installs `orcker` - and your installed tools (`php`, `composer`, ...) - onto your shell `PATH`. On a packaged Linux install `orcker` itself is already on `PATH`, so this is mainly how Linux users get the PHP/tool shims on `PATH` too.
- **Appearance.** A System / Light / Dark theme selector; a **Tray icon** selector (Automatic, Light Y, Dark Y, Full icon) for the menu bar / system tray icon; a **Title bar** selector (Automatic, macOS, Linux, Linux (Reversed), Windows) that forces a window-control style regardless of host platform; and a **Preferred editor** selector (macOS and Linux) choosing which editor the Open-in-editor button uses - Auto-detect, any detected editor (VS Code, VSCodium, Cursor, Zed, Sublime Text, PhpStorm, Windsurf), or System default (open folder). Auto-detect picks the highest-ranked editor you have installed, preferring a dedicated PHP IDE over a general editor. **Rescan** re-runs detection if you install an editor while Orcker is open. All apply live and are remembered across launches.

### PHP

<ThemedImage light="/images/php-light.png" dark="/images/php-dark.png" alt="PHP versions page" />

Manages your installed [PHP versions](./php-versions):

- A table of installed versions showing live FPM pool state, patch level, pool memory (RSS), and whether an update is available.
- Install opens a picker of installable versions (already-installed ones are hidden). Installs download a prebuilt static build; progress streams live next to the Install button as it happens.
- Refresh re-checks for updates. Update all updates every version with a pending update. Updates are notify-only.
- Each row's `⋯` menu offers Restart (only when the pool is running or failed), Update (only when available), Set default (marks it with a star), and Uninstall. Restart all restarts every running pool.
- A Default settings card edits the global ini defaults applied to every version: `memory_limit`, `max_execution_time`, `max_input_time`, `max_file_uploads`, `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`, `error_reporting`, and `display_errors`. Leave a field blank to use PHP's built-in default. Saving restarts running pools to apply.
- A Per-version configuration card lists your versions down the side, newest first. Picking one scopes everything to that version: a settings form overriding the defaults above (empty fields inherit), its custom extensions, free-form ini directives, and its FPM pool size. See [Per-version configuration](./php-versions#per-version-configuration).
- The Extensions section of that card registers extra `.so` extensions for the selected version (loaded into both FPM and the CLI): Add… browses for the file, optionally names it and toggles Zend extension. Each is load-probed before saving, and any whose file has gone missing is flagged. See [Custom extensions](./php-versions#custom-extensions).
- **FPM pool size** sets how many PHP workers that version may run at once (`pm.max_children`, 1-1024, default 16). It applies to the web pool only, never the CLI. The pool is on-demand, so a higher ceiling costs nothing while idle - raise it when requests queue behind queue workers, parallel test runs, or long-lived streams. Saving restarts that version's pool. See [Pool size](./php-versions#pool-size).

### Sites

<ThemedImage light="/images/sites-light.png" dark="/images/sites-dark.png" alt="Sites page" />

The home base for [managing sites](./sites). Polls the daemon every 5 seconds while running, so sites added or changed elsewhere show up without a manual refresh. Two cards:

Parked folders. Each parked directory shows a count of the `.test` sites it produces (one per child directory). Park folder opens a native directory picker; each row's menu offers Reveal folder or Un-park (with confirmation).

Sites. Every parked and linked site is a card: the `name.test` URL (click to open in your browser), the document root, and badges for kind (`parked`/`linked`), PHP version, HTTPS/HTTP, and the [served web root](./sites#web-root-the-served-directory) when it isn't the project root. A `+N` badge appears when the site answers extra domains beyond its apex, and an amber warning shows when another site claims this site's apex. A WordPress site with one-click login enabled also gets a small chip that signs you straight into `wp-admin`.

The card itself keeps only the inline shortcuts - open, the HTTPS lock, and that WordPress chip. **Everything else about a site lives in its details sidebar**, which the card's pencil button slides in from the right.

The filter box above the list matches **any** domain a site answers, not just its name - typing `admin.` finds `codestash.test` when its only match is an added `admin.codestash.test`.

Sites can also be organized into named, reorderable groups shown as collapsible sections on this page; see [Sites](./sites) for the full walkthrough. The **Create** menu at the top of the page offers New Laravel site…, New WordPress site…, Link existing site, Park folder, and New group….

#### The site details sidebar

Four tabs, covering everything Orcker knows about one site:

- **General.** An **Open site** button, then a row of actions - **Terminal** (opens your terminal in the project directory), the **editor** button (macOS and Linux), **Dumps** or **WP Admin** depending on the site, and **Share publicly…** (a [Cloudflare Quick Tunnel](#share)). Below them: PHP version, the **Editor** used for this site, the path (with reveal), the served web root (blank means auto-detect), the URL, the **HTTPS** toggle, **WordPress Auto Admin Login** with an admin picker on WordPress sites, its [group](./sites#site-groups), and - for a linked site only - **Unlink**. Parked sites have no destructive action here; remove them by un-parking their folder, or they'd reappear.
- **Domains.** Set the primary domain and add or remove aliases, subdomains, and wildcards. See [Domains](../reference/cli/domains).
- **Routing.** The **Route through front controller** switch (on: everything funnels through `index.php`, as Laravel and Symfony want; off: named `.php` files execute directly), and beneath it the per-prefix [routing rules](../reference/cli/routes) that carve exceptions out of that default - a nested `api/index.php`, or `index.html` for an SPA.
- **Information.** A read-only summary: detected application, every domain the site answers, web root, kind, protocol, front-controller mode, and WordPress auto-login state.

The **Editor** row defaults to the Preferred editor set in [Settings](#settings), shown as `Use default (…)`; pick a specific editor to override it for that one site, and the choice is remembered.

::: tip Untrusted CA banner
If your local CA isn't trusted in the system store, the Sites view shows a banner (browsers will warn on HTTPS sites until fixed). It links to the **Doctor** page's Environment panel, where one click runs the fix. See [HTTPS & Certificates](./https).
:::

### Tooling

<ThemedImage light="/images/tooling-light.png" dark="/images/tooling-dark.png" alt="Tooling page" />

Installs self-contained developer tools - Composer, Node, and Bun - onto your PATH alongside PHP, each managed by Orcker (install / update / uninstall) so they don't collide with system installs. See [Tooling](./tooling).

### Proxies

Puts a `.test` address in front of a service Orcker doesn't run itself. Two cards, matching the two shapes of [reverse proxy](./proxies):

- **Whole-host proxies** - `reverb.test` → an upstream URL. Each row opens in the browser, toggles HTTPS, and has a **Manage domains** button giving the proxy extra domains, subdomains, and wildcards exactly as a site gets them; a customised proxy shows a `N domains · primary …` hint. Proxy names may be **dotted**, so a proxy's own address can be a subdomain (`api.account.test`).
- **Path rules** - one path on an existing site forwarded to a service (`myapp.test/app` → Reverb), keeping everything same-origin.

The **Add** menu creates either shape. See [Reverse Proxies](./proxies).

### Services

<ThemedImage light="/images/services-light.png" dark="/images/services-dark.png" alt="Services page" />

The database and cache engines Orcker supervises - Redis (Valkey), MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL. Install a version, then Start / Stop / Restart it. Each installed engine's `⋯` menu also offers **Configuration** (copy the Laravel `.env` for that engine - with a database picker that pre-fills `DB_DATABASE` for SQL engines), Edit port, **Override settings**, View logs, **Manage databases** (create / drop / back up / restore, SQL engines only), Change version, and Uninstall. The daemon **auto-starts every installed engine** on boot. See [Services & Databases](./services).

**Override settings** opens a dialog listing the engine's stored [configuration overrides](./services#service-configuration-overrides) - free-form directives for its own config file, such as `max_allowed_packet` or `maxmemory-policy` - with an add form and a remove button per entry. Like Edit port, an override takes effect on the **next start or restart**, not immediately. The item only appears for the engines that have a config file to override; Meilisearch and Reverb are argv-driven, so they don't get it.

### Mail

<ThemedImage light="/images/mail-light.png" dark="/images/mail-dark.png" alt="Mail capture page" />

The built-in SMTP **mail capture** server - point your app's mailer at `127.0.0.1` on the shown port and every outgoing email is captured for preview instead of being sent. Toggle capture, set the port, and open the separate **Mails** viewer with Show Mails. A **Laravel configuration** card emits the `.env` mail keys (`MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, …) to paste into your app, with editable From name/address. Captured mail is tracked read/unread: the sidebar **Mail** item shows an unread-count pill (click it to jump straight to the viewer), and opening a message marks it read. See [Mail Capture](./mail).

### Dumps

<ThemedImage light="/images/dumps-light.png" dark="/images/dumps-dark.png" alt="Dumps page" />

Laravel telemetry interception - `dump()`/`dd()` plus queries, jobs, views, requests, logs, cache, and outgoing HTTP - streamed to a separate viewer window with no code changes, captured by a per-version PHP extension. Enable interception, pick which signals to record, set the port, and open the viewer with Show Dumps. See [Laravel ▸ Dumps](./laravel-dumps).

### Share

<ThemedImage light="/images/share-light.png" dark="/images/share-dark.png" alt="Share page" />

Publishes a local site to the public internet over Cloudflare Tunnel. A **Cloudflare Tunnel** card shows the detected `cloudflared` version; a **Shared sites** card picks a site and opens a Quick Tunnel with one click, alongside a live table of active tunnels. A separate **Named tunnels** card walks through connecting a Cloudflare account and exposing sites on your own domain. See [Sharing Sites](./sharing).

### Doctor

<ThemedImage light="/images/doctor-light.png" dark="/images/doctor-dark.png" alt="Doctor page" />

Mirrors [`orcker doctor`](./diagnostics):

- **Health.** Lists problems by severity (Healthy / Warning / Problem) with a copyable remedy command. Run safe fixes applies the safe one-click fixes; Re-check re-runs diagnostics. A clean machine shows an "all clear" panel.
- **Environment.** OS-level state: Local CA trusted, `.test` resolver installed, and Privileged ports (80/443). A Fix (elevate) button runs the privileged action where a row isn't configured; once a row *is* configured, an **Unelevate** button reverts it - behind an in-app confirm dialog and the OS prompt. Unelevating the `.test` resolver restores your previous resolver on macOS; reverting privileged ports is macOS-only (Linux `setcap` has no clean reverse, so no button is shown there).

::: info "Fix" actions never run the GUI as root
The Fix buttons run the audited `orcker elevate` helper under an OS prompt; the GUI never runs elevated. On Linux this uses `pkexec`, on macOS an `osascript … with administrator privileges` prompt. You may be asked for your password. See [Elevation & Privileges](./elevation).
:::

### About

<ThemedImage light="/images/about-light.png" dark="/images/about-dark.png" alt="About page" />

Shows the app, daemon, and negotiated IPC protocol versions, plus your local environment: the TLD (`.test`), the DNS responder address, and the local CA certificate path and fingerprint (both copyable, with reveal-in-finder). It also links to the project repository.

- **Updates.** A release-channel selector (Stable / Edge pre-releases), a **Check now** button, and the last-checked status (current version, latest stable/edge, and how long ago it checked). When an update is available, an **Apply update** button downloads, verifies, and installs it, restarting the app.
- **Troubleshooting.** **Logs** opens a dialog tailing the GUI's own session log (`orcker-gui.log`) alongside the daemon log, tab-switchable, with a copy button. **Diagnostics** gathers a shareable text snapshot of app/daemon state with its own copy button - useful when reporting a problem.

<ThemedImage light="/images/orcker-logs-light.png" dark="/images/orcker-logs-dark.png" alt="The Logs dialog, tailing the GUI session log" />

<ThemedImage light="/images/orcker-diagnostics-light.png" dark="/images/orcker-diagnostics-dark.png" alt="The Diagnostics dialog, a copyable JSON snapshot of app/daemon state" />

## Keyboard shortcuts

The window is fully keyboard-driven. Shortcuts follow each platform's convention: where macOS uses **Cmd** (`⌘`), Linux uses **Ctrl** with the same letter. Two of them are all you need to remember - the **command palette** (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`) jumps to any page or runs any action by typing, and the **shortcuts** overlay (`⌘/` / `Ctrl+/`) lists everything below in the app itself.

<ThemedImage light="/images/command-search-light.png" dark="/images/command-search-dark.png" alt="The command palette, listing Go to page actions" />

The command palette also lists your sites at the bottom (grouped by domain): **Open** a site in the browser, or **Secure / Unsecure** it (toggle HTTPS), without leaving the keyboard.

<ThemedImage light="/images/keyboard-shortcuts-light.png" dark="/images/keyboard-shortcuts-dark.png" alt="The keyboard shortcuts overlay" />

| Action | macOS | Linux | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Command palette | `⌘K` | `Ctrl+K` | Search-and-run overlay for every page and action |
| Shortcuts | `⌘/` | `Ctrl+/` | Show this list inside the app |
| Go to a page | `⌘1` … `⌘9` | `Ctrl+1` … `Ctrl+9` | Jump straight to a sidebar page (see order below) |
| Settings | `⌘,` | `Ctrl+,` | Open the Settings page |
| Find | `⌘F` | `Ctrl+F` | Focus the page's filter box (Sites, Dumps) |
| New | `⌘N` | `Ctrl+N` | Start the page's primary action (Add site, Install PHP) |
| Refresh | `⌘R` | `Ctrl+R` | Re-fetch the current page's data |
| Restart daemon | `⇧⌘R` | `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Restart `orckerd` |
| Toggle theme | `⇧⌘L` | `Ctrl+Shift+L` | Switch light / dark (applies to every window) |
| Open Mail viewer | `⇧⌘M` | `Ctrl+Shift+M` | Open the standalone Mail capture window |
| Open Dumps viewer | `⇧⌘D` | `Ctrl+Shift+D` | Open the standalone Dumps telemetry window |
| Link Site | `⇧⌘N` | `Ctrl+Shift+N` | Open the Link-site dialog on the Sites page |
| Park Folder | `⇧⌘P` | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Open the park-folder picker on the Sites page |
| Cycle Dumps tabs | `⌃⇥` / `⌃⇧⇥` | `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Move between categories in the Dumps viewer |
| Close window | `⌘W` | `Ctrl+W` | Hide the window to the tray |
| Close dialog | `Esc` | `Esc` | Dismiss the open modal |

`⌘1`…`⌘9` are: **1** Overview, **2** PHP, **3** Sites, **4** Tooling, **5** Services, **6** Mail, **7** Dumps, **8** Settings, **9** Doctor. Proxies and About have no digit - reach them from the sidebar or the command palette.

::: info Quitting the app
There's no Quit shortcut: closing the window (`⌘W` / `Ctrl+W`) hides it to the tray and leaves the daemon running, by design. Quit from the tray menu, or on macOS with the standard `⌘Q`.
