# Sharing Sites

Orcker can **publish a local site to the public internet** over a secure HTTPS URL,
so you can share work in progress, test a webhook, or demo from your own machine
without deploying anything. It works through [Cloudflare
Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)
(`cloudflared`): the connection is **outbound-only** - no inbound ports, no
router config, no `sudo` - which fits Orcker's rootless model.

Sharing is opt-in and per-site. A site is never reachable from the internet until
you explicitly share it.

There are two tiers, and you can use either:

- **Quick share** - one click gives you a random `https://<name>.trycloudflare.com`
  URL. No Cloudflare account, no config, nothing to set up. Best for a quick
  demo or a one-off webhook test.
- **Named tunnels** - a stable hostname on **your own** Cloudflare-managed domain
  (e.g. `app.example.com`), backed by a tunnel on your account. Best when you
  want a URL that doesn't change.

::: warning Anyone with the URL can reach your site
Sharing serves your local site as-is. While a tunnel is up, anyone who has the
URL can load it - there's no auth in front. Stop the tunnel when you're done.
Quick-tunnel URLs are unguessable but public; named hostnames are whatever you
choose.
:::

## Prerequisite: cloudflared

Sharing needs the `cloudflared` binary. If one is already on your `PATH` (version
2023.3.0 or newer), Orcker detects and uses it automatically - nothing to install.
Otherwise Orcker **downloads it on demand** (the official Apache-2.0 static build,
verified by checksum) and installs it under the daemon's data directory - it
isn't bundled, and it never touches your system unless you already had one. No
Cloudflare account is required for quick share.

```sh
orcker tunnel install
```

In the desktop app, the **Share** page offers an **Install cloudflared** button
the first time you visit. If Orcker is using a `cloudflared` it found on your
`PATH`, the badge is annotated `(system)` and a **Use Orcker's bundled version
instead** button lets you switch to the managed, auto-updating copy.

## Quick share

The fastest way to put a site online:

```sh
orcker tunnel share app        # -> https://calm-river-1234.trycloudflare.com
orcker tunnel status           # see live tunnels and their URLs
orcker tunnel stop app         # take it back offline
```

Orcker points `cloudflared` at the site's own loopback listener and rewrites the
`Host` header to the site's `.test` name, so the request routes through the same
proxy that serves the site locally - a secure (HTTPS) site is served over HTTPS,
a plain site over HTTP, transparently. You don't configure any of that.

Quick tunnels are **ephemeral**: the URL changes every time you start one, and
they're torn down when you stop them or the daemon exits. They carry Cloudflare's
quick-tunnel limits (around 200 concurrent requests, and no server-sent events),
so they're for development, not production traffic.

::: tip "Server IP address could not be found"?
That's your machine's DNS resolver, not Orcker - some ISP resolvers don't resolve
fresh `*.trycloudflare.com` names. Point your system DNS at `1.1.1.1` or
`8.8.8.8` and the URL resolves immediately.

## Named tunnels

Named tunnels publish a site at a **stable hostname on a domain you already manage
in Cloudflare**. They need a one-time browser login to your Cloudflare account.

Orcker uses a single consolidated tunnel that serves every site you expose (one
process, one config), so you create the tunnel once and then just toggle which
sites are live.

### 1. Connect your Cloudflare account

```sh
orcker tunnel login
```

This opens your browser to authorize Orcker for one of your Cloudflare zones. The
account certificate is stored in the daemon's data directory and never leaves
your machine. After login, Orcker resolves and shows the **authorized domain**
(e.g. `example.com`) so you know which hostnames you can use.

### 2. Create a tunnel

```sh
orcker tunnel create my-tunnel
```

Orcker supports one named tunnel at a time; remove it before creating another.

### 3. Expose a site

Map a site to a public hostname on your authorized domain, then publish:

```sh
orcker tunnel set-host app app.example.com   # route DNS + record the mapping
orcker tunnel publish                        # bring the tunnel up for all exposed sites
orcker tunnel list                           # show the tunnel, exposed sites, and domain
```

`set-host` creates the proxied DNS record on your Cloudflare zone and remembers
the mapping. `publish` starts the consolidated tunnel; `unpublish` stops it.

To stop exposing a site:

```sh
orcker tunnel set-host app --clear           # remove the mapping
```

## In the desktop app

The [desktop app](./desktop-app) has a **Share** page under the **Integrations**
group in the sidebar (also reachable from the command palette). When any site is
shared, the sidebar item shows a count.

- The **Shared sites** card has a searchable site picker and a **Share** button
  for quick tunnels, plus a live table of active tunnels with copy-URL and stop
  controls.
- Each site's `⋯` menu on the [Sites page](./sites) also has a **Share
  publicly…** shortcut that jumps straight to sharing that site, without going
  to the Share page first:

  <ThemedImage light="/images/share-site-light.png" dark="/images/share-site-dark.png" alt="The Sites page row menu, with a Share publicly… action" />

- The **Named tunnels** card walks you through connecting your Cloudflare account,
  creating the tunnel, and choosing which sites to expose. Each site's hostname
  box is pre-filled with `{site}.{your-domain}`. Exposing a site brings the
  tunnel up automatically and removing the last one takes it back down, so you
  rarely touch the lifecycle yourself; a **Start/Restart** button is there to
  recover the tunnel if its `cloudflared` process dies.

## Removing a named tunnel

```sh
orcker tunnel delete my-tunnel
```

This stops the tunnel, deletes it from your Cloudflare account, removes its local
credentials, and clears the exposed-site mappings, leaving a clean slate. The
**DNS records** you created with `set-host`/`route` are *not* removed - delete
those in the Cloudflare dashboard if you no longer want them.

## How it stays safe

- `cloudflared` runs **unprivileged**, as the daemon user. Sharing never invokes
  the privileged helper and never opens a listening port - the tunnel dials out.
- The account certificate and per-tunnel credentials live in a daemon-owned `0700`
  directory; the desktop app never reads them.
- Nothing is shared until you ask, and quick tunnels are torn down on daemon
  shutdown.

## Command reference

See the [`orcker tunnel` CLI reference](../reference/cli/tunnel) for every command
and flag. The persisted mappings live in the `[tunnel]` section of the [config
file](../reference/configuration#tunnel).
