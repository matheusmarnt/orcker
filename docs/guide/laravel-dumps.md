# Laravel Dumps

Orcker can capture live **Laravel telemetry** - `dump()` / `dd()` output, database
queries, queue jobs, rendered views, incoming requests, log writes, cache events,
and outgoing HTTP calls - and stream it into a dedicated viewer in the
[desktop app](./desktop-app), Herd-style. You see what your app is doing without
sprinkling `dd()` everywhere or tailing log files.

Capture works through a native PHP extension (`orcker-dump`) that observes your app
at the engine level, so **your application needs no changes** - no
`composer require`, no service provider, no `auto_prepend_file`.

::: info Off by default
Dump capture is **disabled by default**. Nothing is downloaded, loaded, or
listening until you turn it on. See [Enabling it](#enabling-it) below.
:::

::: tip Requires a Laravel app (mostly)
Most categories - jobs, views, requests, logs, cache - are Laravel-specific.
Dumps and database queries are framework-agnostic (queries are observed at the
`PDO` level), so a plain PHP app still gets those. The richest experience is a
Laravel app served through Orcker as a `.test` site.

## In the desktop app

The fastest way to use Dumps is from the [desktop app](./desktop-app). Open the
**Dumps** page under the **Developer** group in the side navigation.

<ThemedImage light="/images/dumps-light.png" dark="/images/dumps-dark.png" alt="The Dumps page in the Orcker desktop app" />

- **Dump-server status** shows whether the loopback capture server is running.
- The **Enable interception** toggle turns capture on. The first enable
  downloads the extension and restarts your pools; after that it is instant.
- The **per-signal switches** - dumps/dd, queries, jobs, views, requests, logs,
  cache, and outgoing HTTP - are **disabled until interception is on**. Once it
  is, flip each signal independently to keep the viewer focused.
- The **port** (default `2304`) is shown and editable, and the page lists the
  **per-PHP-version extension presence** so you can see which installed PHP
  versions have a matching `orcker-dump` build.
- **Show Dumps** opens the standalone viewer window where captured events
  stream in, grouped by request.

## What you get

Captured events are grouped into categories, one per tab in the viewer:

| Category | What it captures |
|---|---|
| **Dumps** | `dump()`, `dd()`, `ddd()` calls (rendered HTML + plain-text fallback) |
| **Queries** | Eloquent / PDO database queries, with SQL, bindings, and timing |
| **Jobs** | Dispatched queue jobs and their outcome (processing / processed / failed) |
| **Views** | Rendered Blade views and their bound data keys |
| **Requests** | A summary of each incoming HTTP request (method, URI, status, duration) |
| **Logs** | Log writes, with level and context |
| **Cache** | Cache hits, misses, writes, and forgets |
| **HTTP** | Outgoing HTTP client calls (curl / Guzzle / PSR-18) |

Events are grouped **by request**, so you can see everything a single page load
or job did together.

## Enabling it

Turn capture on from the **Dumps** view in the desktop app (in the side
navigation). Enabling it does two things:

1. **Downloads the native extension.** Orcker fetches the matching `orcker-dump`
   extension for **each installed PHP version** from the
   [`forjedio/orcker-php-ext`](https://github.com/forjedio/orcker-php-ext) releases,
   verifies it by SHA-256, and stores it alongside your PHP installs at
   `{data}/php-ext/php-<version>/orcker-dump.so`.
2. **Restarts your PHP-FPM pools** so they load the extension.

After that, dumps flow into the viewer as you exercise your app.

::: info Needs a matching released build
The extension is ABI-specific: there is one build per PHP minor, per OS, per
architecture. If a build for your exact PHP version and platform hasn't been
published yet, Orcker quietly skips that version - capture simply won't work for it
until a matching `.so` ships. The Dumps view shows, per installed PHP version,
whether a matching extension is present.

The download is **best-effort**: a network or verification failure is logged and
leaves your sites running normally, just without capture.
:::

::: warning No dumps on legacy PHP
[Legacy PHP versions](./php-versions#legacy-php-versions) (7.4 / 8.0 / 8.1) never
capture dumps - the `orcker-dump` extension isn't built for out-of-support PHP. The
Dumps view flags legacy rows as **"Unsupported (no dumps)"** and shows a warning
banner when a legacy version is installed.
:::

::: tip Toggling is cheap after the first enable
The extension reads a small state file at the start of every request and
self-disables when capture is off, so turning capture (or an individual category)
on and off again does **not** restart PHP. Only the first enable - which has to
download the extension and load it - restarts your pools.
:::

## Per-category toggles

Each category can be turned on or off independently from the Dumps view. This is
useful when one category is noisy (lots of queries on a busy page) or when you
only care about one signal.

The **outgoing HTTP** category is **off by default** even when capture is enabled
- it carries a little extra overhead and is less commonly needed. The other seven
categories are on by default. Toggling a category takes effect on the next
request, with no restart.

## Persisting across requests

By default the viewer shows a **rolling window of the most recent requests** and
clears older ones as new requests arrive, so you're looking at what just
happened. Turn on **persist** to keep events accumulating across requests
instead, which is handy when you're watching a sequence of requests (a queue
worker chewing through jobs, say) and don't want earlier ones to disappear.

The viewer holds a bounded buffer of the most recent events, so very old events
are eventually evicted either way.

## The Dumps window

The desktop app gives Dumps its own space:

- **The Dumps view** lives in the main window (in the side navigation), where you
  enable capture, manage the per-category toggles and persist option, and browse
  captured events by tab.
- **A standalone Dumps window** can be popped out so you can keep dumps visible
  next to your editor and browser while the rest of the app stays out of the way.

<ThemedImage light="/images/dumps-dialog-light.png" dark="/images/dumps-dialog-dark.png" alt="The Orcker Dumps window showing captured dump events" />

You can filter by category (the tabs), clear the buffer, and remove individual
events.

## How it works

When capture is enabled, Orcker's [daemon](./daemon) runs a small TCP server bound
to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) on a configurable port (default **2304**). The
`orcker-dump` extension - loaded into each PHP-FPM pool - opens a connection per
request and streams one compact JSON frame per event. The daemon buffers those
frames in memory and serves them to the desktop app.

Everything stays on your machine: the server binds loopback only, and if the port
is already in use the daemon logs it and retries rather than failing - capture is
never allowed to take your sites down.

::: info No CLI commands
Dumps is driven entirely from the desktop app. There are no `orcker` CLI
subcommands for it. Its settings are stored in your
[config file](../reference/configuration) under a `[dumps]` table (`enabled`,
`port`, `persist`, and per-feature toggles), which the app keeps in sync.
