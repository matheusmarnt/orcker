# PHP Versions

Orcker runs **any number of PHP versions side by side** and lets you pick which one each site uses. PHP isn't bundled, so the install stays small. The first time you ask for a version, Orcker downloads a prebuilt, statically-linked PHP build that Orcker publishes itself (signed and checksummed) and supervises one PHP-FPM pool per version behind the [reverse proxy](./sites).

## In the desktop app

The fastest way to manage PHP is the **PHP** page (under the **Environment** group) in the [desktop app](./desktop-app#php). It's a live view of every installed version and the controls to change them, with no commands to remember.

<ThemedImage light="/images/php-light.png" dark="/images/php-dark.png" alt="The PHP page in the Orcker desktop app" />

- A table of installed versions shows live FPM pool state, patch level, pool memory (RSS), and whether an update is available.
- **Install** opens a picker of installable versions (already-installed ones are hidden); progress streams live next to the Install button as the prebuilt static build downloads. An **Install a legacy version** toggle (off by default) swaps the picker over to the [legacy minors](#legacy-php-versions) (7.4 / 8.0 / 8.1) behind a warning block and a mandatory confirmation checkbox; when every current version is already installed the toggle starts on and locks there, since legacy is all that's left to add.
- **Refresh** re-checks for updates and **Update all** updates every version with one pending - [updates are notify-only](#updates-are-notify-only).
- Each row's `⋯` menu offers **Restart**, **Set default** (marks it with a star; disabled for legacy rows, which are tagged with a `legacy` badge), **Update** (when available), and **Uninstall**; **Restart all** restarts every running pool.
- A **Default settings** card edits the [global ini defaults](#tuning-php-settings) applied to every version; leave a field blank to use PHP's built-in default, and saving restarts running pools to apply.
- A **Per-version configuration** card lists your versions down the side, newest first; picking one shows everything scoped to it: the settings form (empty fields inherit the defaults; see [Per-version configuration](#per-version-configuration)), its [custom extensions](#custom-extensions), an **FPM pool size** field (how many PHP workers that version may run at once), and a free-form ini-directive editor (e.g. `xdebug.mode = debug`). Each row badges how much that version has configured and marks unsaved edits, so switching versions never loses work. Saving restarts only that version's pool.

## From the command line

### Installing a version

```sh
orcker install php 8.5
```

Orcker detects your platform (`linux`/`macos`, `x86_64`/`aarch64`), fetches Orcker's signed `php.json` manifest, resolves the single published build for your platform and minor, downloads the CLI and FPM tarballs, verifies each against its published SHA-256, then atomically swaps them into place. The manifest is the source of truth for what's installable, so a new PHP patch becomes available as soon as Orcker's build pipeline publishes it.

Installs are **idempotent**: running it again replaces the directory with a fresh download of the current build. If the version isn't published for your platform, the install fails cleanly and writes nothing. The running daemon picks up a new version automatically, no restart required.

::: info A version is always a major.minor
A "PHP version" means a `major.minor` pair like `8.5`, never a full patch like `8.3.12`. Orcker installs and tracks the latest patch of the minor you ask for, and updates move you to a newer patch of that same minor. Input is `8.5` (or `php8.5`); major must be `5..=9`, minor `0..=99`.
:::

::: info Downloads are signed and hash-verified
The `php.json` manifest is signed with a dedicated minisign key whose public half is embedded in Orcker; the daemon verifies that signature before trusting the manifest, then verifies each downloaded tarball against the SHA-256 the manifest lists. Because PHP runs as you, this verification is on the install critical path, not just updates.
:::

### Legacy PHP versions

Orcker also serves three **out-of-support** minors - **7.4**, **8.0**, and **8.1** -
from a separate, independently-signed `php-legacy.json` manifest. It's the same
minisign key and the same per-tarball SHA-256 verification as `php.json`, just a
different listing.

These versions are past their upstream end of life and may contain **unpatched
security vulnerabilities**, so installing one requires an explicit opt-in:

```sh
orcker install php 7.4 --legacy
```

Running `orcker install php 7.4` without `--legacy` refuses and prints an
out-of-support warning instead of installing. In the desktop app, the Install
picker's **Install a legacy version** toggle replaces the version list with the
legacy minors and opens a warning block and a mandatory confirmation checkbox
("I understand and want to install this legacy version anyway.") before the
Install button is enabled.

A legacy version carries hard restrictions once installed:

- **Cannot be the global default.** `orcker use 7.4` is refused; the desktop app
  disables **Set default** for legacy rows.
- **No code coverage.** `phpcover`, `php7.4cover` / `php8.0cover` / `php8.1cover`,
  and `orcker coverage` all error rather than run - see [Code Coverage](./code-coverage).
- **No orcker-dumps capture.** The Dumps view flags legacy rows as unsupported -
  see [Laravel Dumps](./laravel-dumps).
- **No `pcov` or `orcker-dump` `.so` builds.** Neither extension is built for EOL
  PHP, which is why coverage and dumps don't work on legacy versions.

A legacy version **can** still be assigned to an individual site
(`orcker use my-app 7.4`), just not as the global default. See
[Per-site versions](#per-site-versions).

### Bundled extensions

Orcker's builds ship the **bulk** extension set, so a real-world Laravel app has
what it needs out of the box - highlights include **`intl`** (ICU, required by
Laravel's `Number` helper), **`sodium`**, **`mysqli`**, **`gd`**, **`imagick`**,
**`redis`**, **`opcache`**, and **`swoole`**. Database access is covered by the
**`pdo_mysql`**, **`pdo_pgsql`**, and **`pdo_sqlite`** PDO drivers (so
`PDO::getAvailableDrivers()` returns all three) alongside the native `mysqli`,
`pgsql`, and `sqlite3` extensions. Coverage is provided separately by `pcov` - see
[Code Coverage](./code-coverage).

The authoritative list for any install is `php -m` (via the
[`php` shim](#the-global-default)); the full set for the current builds is below.
It rarely changes between patch updates.

[`orcker php ext`](#custom-extensions).

[Legacy versions](#legacy-php-versions) (7.4 / 8.0 / 8.1) ship a smaller, uniform
extension set built once across all three EOL minors, dropping a few extensions
that need PHP 8.0+ or a newer `swoole` than 7.4 can run.

Dropped versus the stable builds:

- **`opentelemetry`** - requires PHP 8.0+, which breaks the 7.4 build outright.
- **`swoole`** - the pinned `swoole` build needs a newer PHP than 7.4 and would
  fragment across the three EOL minors, so it's dropped to keep one uniform
  legacy set.
- **`swoole-hook-mysql`** - depends on `swoole`.
- **`pcov` and `orcker-dump`** - the external `.so` partners from
  [`forjedio/orcker-php-ext`](https://github.com/forjedio/orcker-php-ext) aren't
  built for EOL PHP, which is why [coverage](./code-coverage) and
  [dumps](./laravel-dumps) don't work on legacy versions.

</details>

### Custom extensions

When you need an extension Orcker's builds don't ship (a PECL module like `scrypt`,
or your own compiled `.so`), register it with `orcker php ext`. Orcker loads it into
**both** the web (FPM) runtime and the CLI for that version, so `extension_loaded()`
returns `true` on a `.test` route and `php -m` lists it - the two used to diverge.

```sh
orcker php ext add 8.5 /opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20250925/scrypt.so
orcker php ext list
orcker php ext remove 8.5 scrypt
```

- **Extensions are tied to a PHP version.** A native `.so` is compiled against one
  PHP *minor*, so you register it under the version it was built for (`8.5` above);
  it loads only for that version.
- **Every add is load-probed.** Before saving, Orcker actually loads the `.so` into
  that version's PHP and rejects it if it can't load - a wrong-version build, a
  missing dependency, or a Zend extension registered without `--zend` fails with a
  clear message instead of silently breaking your pools.
- **Zend extensions** (xdebug/opcache-style) use `--zend`:
  `orcker php ext add 8.5 /path/xdebug.so --zend`.
- **Naming.** The removal handle defaults to the `.so` filename (`scrypt` above);
  override it with `--name`.
- **Missing files** are handled gracefully: if a registered `.so` later disappears
  (e.g. Homebrew bumps its PECL directory on upgrade), Orcker skips it with a warning
  rather than failing to start the pool, and `orcker php ext list` marks it
  `(missing!)`.

Adding or removing an extension restarts that version's running FPM pool to apply
it. In the desktop app, the same registry lives in the **Extensions** section of
the **Per-version configuration** card on the **PHP** page: pick the version's
tab, then **Add…** to browse for a `.so`. An extension whose file has gone
missing is flagged, and its `⋯` menu can seed a matching ini directive. Registered
extensions are stored per version in the config file - see the
[Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration#php).

### How versions are stored

Each install lands under the per-user data directory:

```text
{data}/php/php-8.5/bin/php          # the CLI interpreter
{data}/php/php-8.5/sbin/php-fpm     # the FastCGI process manager
{data}/php/php-8.5/.orcker-version    # the exact patch installed, e.g. "8.5.6"
{data}/bin/php                      # the default-version CLI shim
{data}/bin/php8.5                   # a per-version CLI shim
```

The dir is named for the **major.minor** (`php-8.5`); `.orcker-version` records the exact patch (`8.5.6`). Update checks read that marker to decide whether a newer patch exists. The daemon discovers installed versions by walking this directory and finding each `sbin/php-fpm` at startup.

### The global default

Orcker has one **global default** version, used for the `php` shim at `{data}/bin/php` and as the fallback for any site that hasn't pinned its own. Set it with one argument:

```sh
orcker install php 8.5
orcker use 8.5
```

A fresh config defaults to **PHP 8.3**, but you'll usually set your own right after installing.

::: warning Legacy versions can't be the default
A [legacy version](#legacy-php-versions) (7.4 / 8.0 / 8.1) is ineligible as the
global default - `orcker use 7.4` is refused client-side, and the desktop app
disables **Set default** for legacy rows. It can still be pinned to an
individual site.
:::

::: tip Add the shim dir to your PATH
Put `{data}/bin` (Orcker prints the exact path) on your `PATH` so a bare `php` matches the version your sites run. The bare `php` shim resolves the current default at run time, so `orcker use` takes effect immediately with nothing to re-point.
:::

Alongside the default `php` shim, Orcker maintains a `php<version>` shim for each installed version (`php8.4`, `php8.3`, ...) so you can reach a specific version directly, plus `phpcover` / `php<version>cover` shims that run PHP with the pcov coverage driver enabled. See [Code Coverage](./code-coverage). Each shim runs the right PHP with that version's ini and any [custom extensions](#custom-extensions) you've registered.

### Per-site versions

Any site can pin its own version. Pass `orcker use` two arguments, a site name and a version:

```sh
orcker use my-app 8.3
```

Now `my-app.test` runs on 8.3 while every other site follows the global default.

| Site setting | Effective version |
|---|---|
| Pinned (`orcker use <site> 8.3`) | `8.3` |
| Not pinned | the global default |

Clearing a pin reverts the site to whatever the global default is at the time.

Check what each site resolves to with `orcker sites`, which lists every site with its kind, PHP version, HTTPS state, and document root. See [Sites](./sites) for parking and linking.

::: warning Pin a version you've installed
Pinning a site (or the default) to an uninstalled version means there's no FPM binary to start when a request arrives. Install it first (`orcker install php 8.3`), then pin. `orcker doctor` flags a pool that can't start.
:::

### Site-aware CLI: `orcker exec` and `orcker which`

A site's version governs how it is **served**, but the bare `php` and `composer` shims always use the **global default**. So inside a site on 8.3 while your default is 8.5, `php artisan` and `composer install` run on 8.5 - a different version than the site's own web requests.

`orcker exec` closes that gap. It runs a tool under the version of the site containing your current directory:

```sh
cd ~/Sites/my-app     # served on 8.3
orcker exec php -v      # PHP 8.3.x
orcker exec php artisan migrate
orcker exec composer install
```

Everything after the tool is passed straight through, so no `--` separator is needed - which also means orcker's own flags (`--site`, `--json`) must come **before** the tool:

```sh
orcker exec --site my-app php -v      # from anywhere
orcker exec composer show --json      # --json here belongs to Composer
```

`orcker which php` prints the absolute path of the binary `orcker exec` would use, resolved identically:

```sh
$ cd ~/Sites/my-app && orcker which php
/Users/you/Library/Application Support/io.orcker.Orcker/php/php-8.3/bin/php

$ orcker --json which php
{"path":"…/php-8.3/bin/php","version":"8.3","site":"my-app","source":"site"}
```

`source` is `site` when the version came from a site and `default` otherwise (with `site` then `null`), so scripts can tell the two apart.

How resolution falls out:

| Where you run it | Which PHP |
|---|---|
| Inside a registered site | that site's stored version |
| Outside every site | the global default |
| With `--site <name>` | that site's stored version, from anywhere |

::: warning A linked site's version doesn't follow the default
Every registered site resolves to a concrete version, so `source` is `site` even for one you never ran `orcker use <site> <version>` against - there is no "unpinned" state to report.

The two site kinds get that version differently, which matters when you change the global default:

- **Linked** sites **snapshot** the default at link time. Changing the default later does not move them.
- **Parked** sites follow the current default, unless you've pinned one explicitly.

```sh
orcker link my-app      # default is 8.4 → my-app stores 8.4
orcker use 8.5          # global default moves to 8.5
php -v                # 8.5 - the bare shim follows the default
orcker exec php -v      # 8.4 - my-app is still *served* on 8.4
```

`orcker exec` is right here: it matches how the site actually runs. But it is deliberately not the same as "inherits the default". To move a linked site too, pin it explicitly with `orcker use my-app 8.5`. `orcker sites` shows what each site currently resolves to.
:::

Two deliberate failure rules:

- **A stored-but-uninstalled version is an error**, not a silent fallback: running under an unrelated default PHP with no indication why is worse than stopping. Install it (`orcker install php 8.3`) and retry.
- **`--site` never falls back.** You named a site, so an unknown name - or a daemon that isn't running to resolve it - is an error rather than a quiet switch to the default. Without `--site`, an unreachable daemon just means "not inside a site", and the global default is used - with a warning on stderr, since inside a site that would otherwise silently run the wrong version.

`orcker exec composer` runs the same bundled phar the `composer` shim does, just under the site's PHP (and that version's CLI ini).

::: tip The shims are unchanged
`php`, `php<version>`, and `composer` behave exactly as before - `php` still means the global default everywhere. `orcker exec` is an addition, not a change in what your existing commands do.
:::

Because everything after the tool is forwarded, `-h`/`--help` reach the tool too: `orcker exec composer --help` prints Composer's help. Use `orcker help exec` for the command's own. See the [Exec and Which reference](../reference/cli/exec) for the full flag surface and exit codes.

### Listing versions

```sh
orcker list php
```

This shows every installed version, marks the default, and flags any with a newer patch available. Update flags come from the **daemon's cache** by default, so no network call is made and the command is instant.

| Command | What you get |
|---|---|
| `orcker list php` | Installed versions, default, cached update flags (no network) |
| `orcker list php --check` | Same, but polls the distribution now to refresh update flags |
| `orcker list php --available` | Versions installable from the distribution, tagging installed ones |

`--available` takes precedence over `--check`. Add `--json` (a global flag) for machine-readable output.

### Updates are notify-only

Orcker checks for newer **patches** of the minors you have and tells you about them, but never installs on its own. The daemon periodically polls the distribution, compares each installed minor's latest patch against its `.orcker-version` marker, and on a newer patch logs:

```text
a newer PHP patch is available (run `orcker update php`)
```

It records this in the cache `orcker list php` reads. The poll is failure-tolerant: a network or platform failure is logged quietly and your cached state is left untouched.

Update on your terms:

```sh
orcker update php 8.5     # update just 8.5 to its latest patch
orcker update php         # update every installed version
```

An update is the same atomic install flow: it moves `8.5.4` → `8.5.6` and never jumps to a different minor. To move minors, run `orcker install php 8.6` and `orcker use 8.6` explicitly.

::: tip Nothing updates behind your back
Updates are strictly notify-only. The only automatic network call is the lightweight update check, which downloads nothing but a directory listing. Orcker downloads or swaps a PHP version only when you run `orcker update php`.
:::

### Tuning PHP settings

Orcker keeps a small set of **global PHP ini defaults** that are applied to *every*
installed version's FPM pool. Set and clear them with `set` / `unset`:

```sh
orcker set php memory_limit 512M
orcker set php upload_max_filesize 64M
orcker unset php memory_limit          # reset to PHP's built-in default
```

Only an allowlisted set of directives is accepted (e.g. `memory_limit`,
`max_execution_time`, `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`, `display_errors`,
`error_reporting`), and the value is validated client-side before it's sent, so a
typo is a clean error rather than a broken pool. The configured values are echoed
back by `orcker list php` under a `settings:` block. See the [PHP CLI
reference](../reference/cli/php#global-php-ini-settings) for the full list and the
[Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration#php) for how they're stored
and rendered into FPM config.

### Per-version configuration

Every setting can also be pinned for a **single** installed version with the
`--only` flag - the override wins over the global default for that version only,
and applies to both its FPM pool and its CLI:

```sh
orcker set php memory_limit 1G --only 8.3   # only PHP 8.3 gets 1G
orcker unset php memory_limit --only 8.3    # 8.3 inherits the global value again
```

Beyond the allowlist, `orcker php ini` sets **free-form ini directives** per
version - typically the settings of a custom extension. The classic xdebug
setup is two commands:

```sh
orcker php ext add 8.3 /opt/php/xdebug.so --zend   # load the extension
orcker php ini set 8.3 xdebug.mode debug           # configure it
```

Directive names and values are shape-checked so they can never corrupt the
generated config, but Orcker doesn't second-guess their meaning - a directive PHP
doesn't recognise is simply ignored by PHP. A per-version change restarts only
that version's pool, and per-version configuration survives uninstalling and
reinstalling the version.

#### Pool size

`orcker php pool` sets how many PHP workers a version may run at once - FPM's
`pm.max_children`, applied to that version's web pool only:

```sh
orcker php pool set 8.4 max_children 32   # raise the ceiling for PHP 8.4
orcker php pool unset 8.4 max_children    # back to the default of 16
```

The default is 16 and the range is 1 to 1024. Orcker runs pools on demand, so
workers start as requests arrive rather than being held open: a higher ceiling
costs nothing while the pool is idle. Raise it when requests start queueing
behind long-running work - queue workers, parallel test runs, or a lot of open
tabs hitting the same site. Note that `pm.*` names are pool settings rather than
ini directives, so `orcker php ini` refuses them and points here.

In the desktop app the same lives in the
**Per-version configuration** card on the PHP page: pick a version from the list
to get the settings form (empty fields inherit the defaults), an **FPM pool
size** field, that version's extensions, and a directive editor. A version that still has extensions
registered after being uninstalled stays in the list, so those registrations can
be removed. See the
[PHP CLI reference](../reference/cli/php#custom-ini-directives) for the rules
and the denylist of directives Orcker manages elsewhere.

### Command summary

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `orcker install php <version>` | Download + install the latest patch of a minor. |
| `orcker use <version>` | Set the global default version (and the `php` shim). |
| `orcker use <site> <version>` | Pin one site to a version. |
| `orcker exec [--site <name>] <php\|composer> [args…]` | Run a tool under the site's own version instead of the global default. |
| `orcker which [--site <name>] php` | Print the PHP binary `orcker exec` would use. |
| `orcker list php [--check]` | List installed versions; `--check` refreshes update flags. |
| `orcker list php --available` | List versions installable from the distribution. |
| `orcker update php [<version>]` | Update one (or all) versions to the latest patch. |
| `orcker uninstall php <version>` | Remove a version's files (blocked if a site uses it). |
| `orcker restart php [<version>]` | Restart one (or all) running FPM pools. |
| `orcker set php <setting> <value> [--only <version>]` | Set a global PHP ini default, or a per-version override with `--only`. |
| `orcker unset php <setting> [--only <version>]` | Reset a global setting to PHP's built-in value. With `--only`, remove one version's override so the global value applies again. |
| `orcker php ini set <version> <name> <value>` | Set a free-form ini directive (e.g. `xdebug.mode`) for one version. |
| `orcker php ini unset <version> <name>` | Remove a free-form ini directive. |
| `orcker php ini list` | Show per-version overrides, directives, and pool sizes. |
| `orcker php pool set <version> max_children <n>` | Set how many PHP workers that version may run at once (1-1024, default 16). |
| `orcker php pool unset <version> max_children` | Reset the worker ceiling to the default. |
| `orcker php pool list` | Show per-version overrides, directives, and pool sizes. |
| `orcker php ext add <version> <path> [--zend] [--name <name>]` | Register a custom extension (load-probed) for a version. |
| `orcker php ext remove <version> <name>` | Remove a registered extension. |
| `orcker php ext list` | List registered custom extensions, grouped by version. |

Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output.
