# orcker-services

`orcker-services` owns Orcker's **local database and cache services**: installing
prebuilt service binaries, supervising one instance per engine, reporting their
live state, and performing SQL database administration (create / drop / list /
backup / restore). It is the services counterpart to [`orcker-php`](./orcker-php) and
is structured the same way - every *decision* is pure and unit-testable; every
byte of I/O sits behind the [`orcker-supervise`](./orcker-supervise) trait seams.

The config-backed engines it models:

| Service | `id` | Display name | Kind | Default port | Server binary | Overrides |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Redis | `redis` | `Redis (Valkey)` | Cache | 6379 | `valkey-server` | `RedisConf` |
| MySQL | `mysql` | `MySQL` | Database | 3306 | `mysqld` | `MyCnf` |
| MariaDB | `mariadb` | `MariaDB` | Database | 3306 | `mariadbd` | `MyCnf` |
| PostgreSQL | `postgres` | `PostgreSQL` | Database | 5432 | `postgres` | `PostgresConf` |

Two further types are supervised the same way but have **no config file**:
Meilisearch (`meilisearch`, `Search`) and Laravel Reverb (`reverb:<site>`,
`AppServer` - one instance per linked Laravel site, running against that site's
PHP rather than a downloaded binary). Both are argv/env driven, so both accept
no [configuration overrides](#configuration-overrides).

::: info Redis is served by Valkey
The "Redis" slot is filled by **Valkey** - the BSD-licensed fork - because Redis
7.4+ is SSPL/RSALv2 and not cleanly redistributable. It stays wire-compatible, so
clients are unaffected. The server binary is `valkey-server`; the user-facing
display name is `Redis (Valkey)`.

## `service.rs` - pure engine metadata

`Service` (`Redis`, `MySql`, `MariaDb`, `Postgres`) and `ServiceKind` (`Cache`,
`Database`) are compile-time facts about each engine - no I/O. `Service::ALL` is
the canonical 4-element iteration order. Beyond the table at the top of this page,
each `Service` exposes:

| Method | Redis | MySql | MariaDb | Postgres |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `client_binary()` | `None` | `mysql` | `mariadb` | `psql` |
| `dump_binary()` | `None` | `mysqldump` | `mariadb-dump` | `pg_dump` |
| `needs_init()` | false | true | true | true |
| `init_binary()` | `None` | `mysqld --initialize-insecure` | `mariadb-install-db` | `initdb` |
| `kind()` | `Cache` | `Database` | `Database` | `Database` |
| `datadir_pinned_to_major()` | false | false | false | **true** |

MySQL and MariaDB share port 3306, so only one can run on it at a time
(the config layer allows a per-instance override). PostgreSQL pins its data
directory to its major version (`data-<major>`) and refuses to start against a
datadir written by a different major.

## `database.rs` - the SQL-admin security boundary (pure)

All database administration logic is pure and **constructs SQL that cannot be
injected**. The daemon's [`db_admin`](../binaries/orckerd) edge calls these
functions and passes the result to the engine's client as a single argv element -
never through a shell.

- **`validate_db_name(name)`** - strict allowlist: non-empty, ≤ 63 chars (the
  lowest engine cap), first char an ASCII letter or `_`, the rest
  `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. Returns `DbNameError` (`Empty`, `TooLong`, `BadStart`,
  `BadChar(char)`). This policy applies only to databases Orcker creates.
- **`validate_existing_db_name(name)`** - accepts engine-created names selected
  for drop, backup, or restore, including whitespace, punctuation, Unicode, and
  quoting characters. It rejects only empty strings and embedded NUL characters.
- **`is_system_database(service, name)`** - case-insensitive guard. MySQL/MariaDB:
  `information_schema`, `performance_schema`, `mysql`, `sys`; Postgres: `postgres`,
  `template0`, `template1`. System databases cannot be dropped or restored over.
- **`quote_ident(service, name)`** - backticks for MySQL/MariaDB, double-quotes
  for Postgres (each doubling the quote char).
- **`create_sql` / `drop_sql` / `list_sql`** - per-engine statements. Postgres
  drop uses `DROP DATABASE <ident> WITH (FORCE);` (PG13+); Postgres list queries
  `pg_database WHERE datistemplate = false`. List queries return hexadecimal
  UTF-8 so line breaks and surrounding whitespace in names survive client output.
- **`client_args` / `dump_args` / `restore_args`** - build the argv for the
  interactive client / dump tool. MySQL & MariaDB connect over the local **Unix
  socket** as a passwordless `root`; Postgres connects over **TCP loopback** as
  `postgres`. Restore reuses the *client* binary (replaying SQL on stdin), not the
  dump binary.
- **`parse_db_list(service, stdout)`** - decodes hexadecimal names, filters system
  DBs, sorts, and deduplicates without altering database names.

## `config_render.rs` - pure config rendering

One renderer per engine, all returning text the caller writes to disk (no I/O
here):

- **`render_redis_conf`** - loopback bind, `protected-mode`, `daemonize no`, no
  password (local-dev posture).
- **`render_my_cnf`** - one `[mysqld]` renderer for both MySQL and MariaDB: bind
  `127.0.0.1`, `skip-name-resolve`, a Unix socket, and a pid-file.
- **`render_postgresql_conf`** - `listen_addresses = '127.0.0.1'` and
  **`unix_socket_directories = ''`** (Postgres uses TCP loopback only; the macOS
  `sun_path` limit rules out a socket here), with hba/ident pinned to the datadir.

`render_include_lines(dialect, confd_dir)` renders the include line(s) the
manager appends to each rendered config so the engine reads the
[override sidecars](#configuration-overrides) *after* Orcker's own settings. Each
dialect gets its native form: `!includedir` for `MyCnf` and `include_dir` for
`PostgresConf` (both read a directory in name order), while `RedisConf` has no
directory form at all, so both files are named explicitly with `50-local` last -
the order is what carries the precedence.

::: warning `!includedir` has no quoting syntax
Unlike an option *value*, MySQL's `!includedir` directive cannot be quoted, so
the path is emitted raw. A real `mysqld` parses a spaced macOS state path
(`~/Library/Application Support/orcker/...`) that way, which is what makes this
safe; the other two dialects quote exactly as their values do. There are table
tests pinning all three against a spaced path.
:::

## Configuration overrides

An override-capable engine gets a `conf.d/` directory beside its rendered
config, holding two files:

| File | Written by | Rewritten? |
|---|---|---|
| `10-orcker.<ext>` | Orcker, from `[services.<id>.overrides]` | every start |
| `50-local.<ext>` | the user | **never** - created once from a stub |

`Service::override_capability() -> Option<OverrideDialect>` is the capability
descriptor, and its one body delegates to
[`orcker_core::service_directives::dialect_for`](./orcker-core#service-directives),
which the CLI and `orcker-config` also call - so no service type can declare a
capability that disagrees with theirs. `Some` reads as "accepts overrides", and
the dialect determines the line form, the file extension, and the include
directive alike. It surfaces on the wire as
[`ServiceStatus::supports_overrides`](../ipc-protocol#status-doctor-payloads).

Every override-capable engine sets `capture_output_to_log: true` in its launch
plan, including the ones that log to their own file via rendered config. An
invalid directive is reported while the option file is *still being parsed* -
before `mysqld` opens its configured `log-error`, or Valkey its `logfile` - so
without capture that complaint would land on the daemon's inherited stderr and
reach no file at all. The manager and the engine then both append to the same
path, so neither truncates the other's lines. A test asserts the invariant
directly: `override_capable_engines_capture_output_to_the_instance_log`.

## `release.rs` - artifact resolution (pure)

Orcker hosts its **own** multi-platform service distribution (the
`forjedio/orcker-services` build matrix) with a `services.json` listing
(`LISTING_SCHEMA = 1`). `SERVICES_BASE_URL` points at that GitHub release. The
pure functions here resolve a `(service, version, os, arch)` request against a
fetched listing body:

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `resolve_from_listing(...)` | Finds the build for an exact version, returning an `Artifact { service, version, url }`. Errors `VersionUnavailable` / `ListingParse` / `UnsupportedListingSchema`. |
| `available_versions(...)` | Every version published for the platform (infallible; empty on parse error). Feeds the GUI dropdown and `orcker service available`. |
| `artifact_url` / `listing_url` / `platform_token` | URL construction. |
| `current_os_arch()` | Resolves the host `(Os, Arch)`; errors on Windows / 32-bit. |

The daemon performs the actual HTTPS download (via the `Downloader` seam) and
hands the bytes back; integrity rests on HTTPS to the host (there is no separate
checksum sidecar for service builds).

## `version.rs` - layout & discovery

`ServiceVersion` is an opaque, validated version label (services don't share PHP's
major.minor shape). Labels may carry a **variant suffix** after a hyphen -
Postgres publishes both a lean base (`17`) and a PostGIS `17-full` under the same
service. The label is treated as opaque end to end: `release.rs` reads each
`version` string straight from the `services.json` listing (it never splits a
filename), so a hyphen in the label is safe by construction. Ordering
compares component-by-component and ranks a **plain** build above a suffixed one
at the same number (`"17.10" > "17.10-full"`), so `full` is never mistaken for the
"latest" build when resolving the newest version. `ServiceVersion::major()` ignores
the variant suffix (it splits on the first `.` or `-`), so a base and any variant of
the same major **share one datadir** (`data-<major>`) - which is what lets a
`change-version` between base and `full` preserve databases. For a variant install,
`manager.rs` also probes the install tree for `proj.db` / `gdalvrt.xsd` and, when
found, exports `PROJ_DATA` / `GDAL_DATA` into the postmaster environment (base
installs get neither) - what lets `PostGIS` `ST_Transform` / raster reprojection
resolve their runtime data. The on-disk layout under `PlatformDirs`:

```text
{data}/services/<id>/<version>/bin/<server_binary>   # the install (per version/label)
{data}/services/<id>/data                  (or data-<major> for Postgres) # shared datadir
{state}/services/<id>/<id>.conf            # rendered config
{state}/services/<id>/<id>.log             # captured stdout/stderr
{state}/services/<id>/conf.d/10-orcker.<ext> # rendered overrides (rewritten every start)
{state}/services/<id>/conf.d/50-local.<ext> # hand edits (created once, never rewritten)
{runtime}/services/<id>/<id>.sock          # Unix socket (MySQL/MariaDB)
```

The `conf.d/` pair exists only for override-capable engines, and the rendered
config ends with the engine's native include directive pointing at it, so both
files are read after Orcker's own settings.

`discover_installed(&PlatformDirs)` scans for version directories that contain a
real server binary; the daemon calls it at startup.

## `health.rs` - readiness probes

`ReadinessProbe` (service-aware) and `ServiceProbes` (the production dispatcher)
implement [`orcker-supervise`](./orcker-supervise)'s address-only `HealthProbe`. A
bare TCP accept is not enough during datadir init, so each probe requires a real
protocol response:

- **`RedisProbe`** - sends `PING`, expects `+PONG`.
- **`MySqlProbe`** - reads the initial handshake packet (first byte `0x0a`
  greeting or `0xff` ERR). MariaDB reuses this probe (same wire protocol).
- **`PostgresProbe`** - sends a startup message, accepts an `R` (auth) or `E`
  (error) reply tag.

## `manager.rs` - the `ServiceManager` driver

`ServiceManager<S, C, P>` is generic over the `ProcessSpawner`, `Clock`, and
`ReadinessProbe` seams, and always drives the state machine under
`SupervisorPolicy::database()`. It holds one `Instance` per `Service` in a
`BTreeMap` (deterministic shutdown order).

| Method | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `ensure(service, version, port)` | Idempotent. Fast path returns the cached `Listen` if already running; otherwise runs one-time datadir init (staging dir + atomic rename), pre-flights the port via `PortBinder` (→ `PortInUse`), renders + writes the config, and drives the supervisor to `Running`. |
| `restart` / `stop` | Drive the supervisor through a stop (then re-`ensure` for restart). |
| `shutdown()` | Stops every instance in `BTreeMap` order. |
| `snapshots()` | Read-only `ServiceSnapshot { service, version, state, pid, listen }` per instance. |

`ServiceRunState` is `Running` or `Failed` (the daemon fills in `Stopped` for an
engine with no live instance). Per-engine specifics live in `build_cmd` (Redis
`valkey-server <config>`; MySQL/MariaDB `--defaults-file=<config>`; Postgres
`-D <datadir> -c config_file=<config>`) and `stop_protocol` (Postgres →
`MasterInterrupt`, all others → `GroupTerm`).

## How the daemon wires it in

[`orckerd`](../binaries/orckerd) instantiates
`ServiceManager<TokioProcessSpawner, SystemClock, ServiceProbes>` and exposes the
crate over IPC:

- **`bin/orckerd/src/services.rs`** handles `ListServices`, `AvailableServices`
  (downloads the listing on demand), `InstallService` (download + unpack, then
  start), `ChangeServiceVersion` (install → restart → remove old,
  keeping the datadir), `UninstallService` (optional `--purge` deletes data),
  `StartService` / `StopService` (toggle the status-only `enabled` flag; boot
  auto-start keys on installed versions, not this flag), `RestartService`,
  `SetServicePort`, and `ServiceLogs`. The per-service status reports
  `supports_databases` from `ServiceKind`.
- **`bin/orckerd/src/db_admin.rs`** is the I/O edge for database administration. It
  requires a *running* SQL engine with a client binary present, passes the pure
  SQL as a single argv element (no shell), streams `BackupDatabase` to a temp
  sibling and atomically renames it (never truncating the target), and streams
  `RestoreDatabase` into the client's stdin. Create uses the portable name
  allowlist; drop/backup/restore use exact existing names after empty/NUL checks.
  Engine errors are classified into
  typed `ErrorCode`s (`AlreadyExists` / `NotFound` / `Internal`).

See [IPC Protocol](../ipc-protocol) for the full service/database message set.

## Error model

`ServiceError` (`#[non_exhaustive]`, not `Clone + Eq` - it wraps `io::Error` and
`PlatformError`) pins the failure surface: `Unsupported`, `VersionNotInstalled`,
`DiscoveryIo`, `Init`, `Spawn`, `ConfigWrite`, `HealthCheckTimedOut`,
`PermanentFailure`, `PortInUse`, `Bind`, `Kill`, `VersionUnavailable`,
`UnsupportedPlatform`, `ListingParse`, `UnsupportedListingSchema`,
`Download(DownloadError)`, and `Extract`.

::: tip Engine availability is a distribution question, not a code one
All four engines are implemented end-to-end - supervision, init, config rendering,
health probing, and (for the SQL engines) database administration. Whether a given
engine/version installs depends only on whether a prebuilt build is published in
the hosted `services.json` listing for your platform. An unpublished build surfaces
as `VersionUnavailable` rather than a missing feature.
