# orcker-doctor

`orcker-doctor` is the pure decision layer behind `orcker doctor` and `orcker doctor fix`. It takes a typed health snapshot - a [`StatusReport`](./orcker-ipc) - and turns it into two things: a list of human-readable findings ([`Diagnosis`](./orcker-ipc)), and a list of safe, unprivileged repairs the daemon may apply automatically ([`FixAction`]).

The crate is deliberately tiny and runtime-free. It does **no I/O**, spawns no tasks, and touches no filesystem, network, or process. Every byte of "state" it reasons about arrives in the `StatusReport` argument; everything it produces is a return value. The daemon ([orckerd](../binaries/orckerd)) owns all effects - assembling the report, restarting pools, re-running diagnosis - and uses this crate only to decide *what* a snapshot means and *which* fixes are safe.

For the user-facing walkthrough of `orcker doctor`, see [Diagnostics](../../guide/diagnostics).

## Why this crate exists separately

Diagnosis is a pile of conditional rules: "a privileged port that fell back is a warning - unless a pf redirect makes it reachable anyway"; "an undeterminable CA-trust probe must stay silent rather than cry wolf"; "no PHP at all should suppress the narrower *default-not-installed* finding." That logic is worth testing exhaustively and in isolation, with no daemon, no sockets, and no OS. Pulling it into a `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, dependency-light crate (`orcker-core` + `orcker-ipc` only) makes the rules a pure function of an input struct - trivially unit-testable, and impossible to accidentally entangle with I/O.

```toml
# crates/orcker-doctor/Cargo.toml

orcker-core = { path = "../orcker-core" }
orcker-ipc  = { path = "../orcker-ipc" }
```

## File map

The whole crate is one module.

## Public API

### `diagnose(&StatusReport, Option<bool>, &[(String, String, String)]) -> Vec<Diagnosis>`

Runs every check against the report and returns the findings in a stable order.
Everything past the report is daemon-supplied input that can't be read from it,
because this crate does no I/O:

- `path_needs_setup` surfaces a `BinDirNotOnPath` warning when the orcker bin dir
  isn't on `PATH` (`None` = unknown, skip that check).
- `local_override_files` carries one `(service_id, path, content)` tuple per
  override-capable service whose hand-edited
  [`conf.d/50-local.<ext>`](./orcker-services#configuration-overrides) exists. Each
  is scanned with `orcker_core::service_directives::scan_local`, and every issue
  becomes a `ServiceOverrideInvalid` warning. A service id with no dialect is
  skipped, so an argv-driven or unknown service is never scanned.

```rust
#[must_use]
pub fn diagnose(
    report: &StatusReport,
    path_needs_setup: Option<bool>,
    local_override_files: &[(String, String, String)],
) -> Vec<Diagnosis>;
```

::: info The remedy is the user's editor, not a command
Orcker never rewrites `50-local.<ext>` - that is the entire point of the file - so
`ServiceOverrideInvalid` is **not** auto-fixable and its remedy names the file
and a restart rather than a command that would undo the user's work.
:::

Two cross-cutting invariants hold for the output:

- **Always non-empty.** When no `Warn`/`Fail` finding is produced, a single [`DiagnosisCode::AllGood`] `Ok` finding is appended, so a caller always has something to render.
- **No false alarms from unknowns.** Probes typed as `Option<bool>` that come back `None` ("couldn't determine") emit **no** finding. Only an explicit `Some(false)` raises a warning. This is why the CA and resolver checks compare against `Some(false)` rather than `!= Some(true)`.
- **Most-specific port finding wins.** `port_findings` raises `ForeignWebListener` when `report.foreign_web_listener == Some(true)` (a non-Orcker process on 80/443) and *suppresses* the generic `PortFallback` in that case - telling the user to free the port, not to elevate (which can't bind a port someone else owns). An active macOS redirect (`port_redirect == Some(true)`) likewise suppresses `PortFallback`.

### `plan_auto_fixes(&StatusReport) -> Vec<FixAction>`

Returns the safe, unprivileged fixes the daemon may apply for this report.

```rust
#[must_use]
pub fn plan_auto_fixes(report: &StatusReport) -> Vec<FixAction> {
    let mut fixes: Vec<FixAction> = report
        .php
        .iter()
        .filter(|p| p.state == PoolRunState::Failed)
        .map(|p| FixAction::RestartFpm(p.version))
        .collect();
    if report.ca.php_trusts_ca == Some(false) {
        fixes.push(FixAction::RebuildPhpCaBundle);
    }
    fixes
}
```

Conservative by design: the auto-fixes are restarting a failed FPM pool and rebuilding the bundled PHP's CA bundle (`{data}/cacert.pem`) when it's missing or stale - both fast, idempotent, and unprivileged (each writes only user-owned files). Privileged or slow remediation - CA trust, resolver install, `setcap`/pf, PHP install - is never auto-applied; it is left to the user to run the suggested command.

### `is_auto_fixable(DiagnosisCode) -> bool`

```rust
#[must_use]
pub fn is_auto_fixable(code: DiagnosisCode) -> bool {
    matches!(
        code,
        DiagnosisCode::FpmPoolFailed | DiagnosisCode::PhpCaNotTrusted
    )
}
```

Lets the daemon drop already-handled findings from the "manual" remainder it reports after a fix run. It is kept in lockstep with `plan_auto_fixes`: `FpmPoolFailed` and `PhpCaNotTrusted` are the codes both treat as auto-fixable.

### `FixAction`

```rust
/// A safe, fast, unprivileged fix the daemon may apply automatically.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum FixAction {
    /// Restart the FPM pool for this PHP version.
    RestartFpm(PhpVersion),
    /// Rebuild the managed PHP CA bundle (`{data}/cacert.pem`) so the bundled
    /// PHP trusts the Orcker CA again.
    RebuildPhpCaBundle,
}
```

`#[non_exhaustive]` so new variants can be added without a breaking change. Note the payload is a typed `orcker_core::PhpVersion`, not a string - this is the crux of the design decision below.

## Why plan from `StatusReport`, not from `Diagnosis`

A natural-looking alternative API would be `auto_fix(&Diagnosis)`. It does not work, and the crate documents why in its module docs:

> A wire `Diagnosis` carries only strings, so it cannot hand back the typed `PhpVersion` a `FixAction::RestartFpm` needs. Planning fixes from the typed report instead keeps the action list precise.

A [`Diagnosis`](./orcker-ipc) is a *wire* type - `code`, `severity`, `title`, `detail`, and an `Option<String> remedy`. The version of a failed pool only ever appears interpolated into human prose ("The PHP 8.5 FPM pool is not running"). Recovering a `PhpVersion` from that text would mean re-parsing a sentence. By planning from the *typed* `StatusReport`, `plan_auto_fixes` reads `PoolRunState::Failed` entries directly and carries each `PhpPoolStatus::version` straight into a `FixAction::RestartFpm(version)` - no stringly-typed round-trip, no parsing.

This is the same separation the rest of Orcker uses: structured truth in `StatusReport`, presentation in `Diagnosis`.

## No I/O - the daemon owns effects

`diagnose` and `plan_auto_fixes` only read their `&StatusReport` argument and allocate the returned `Vec`s. The daemon supplies the snapshot and applies the effects. The `doctor fix` flow in [orckerd](../binaries/orckerd) is the canonical consumer and shows the full round-trip:

```rust
// bin/orckerd/src/ipc_server.rs - run_doctor_fix (abridged)
let report = build_status_report(state).await;          // daemon does the I/O
let mut performed: Vec<FixResult> = Vec::new();

for action in orcker_doctor::plan_auto_fixes(&report) {     // pure planning
    if let orcker_doctor::FixAction::RestartFpm(v) = action {
        let outcome = { state.php_manager.lock().await.restart(v).await }; // effect
        performed.push(/* FixResult { code: FpmPoolFailed, ok, message } */);
    }
}

// Re-diagnose against a *fresh* report; surface what still needs the user.
let after  = build_status_report(state).await;            // daemon does the I/O again
let manual = orcker_doctor::diagnose(&after)                // pure, on fresh state
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|d| matches!(d.severity, Severity::Warn | Severity::Fail))
    .collect();

Response::DoctorFix { report: FixReport { performed, manual } }
```

The shape of this loop matters:

1. The daemon assembles a `StatusReport` (`build_status_report`).
2. `plan_auto_fixes` turns it into `FixAction`s - *pure*.
3. The daemon performs each action (`PhpManager::restart`) - *effect*.
4. The daemon assembles a **fresh** report and calls `diagnose` again - *pure*, against post-fix reality.
5. Warn/Fail findings from that second pass become `FixReport::manual`.

Re-diagnosing from a freshly-built report (rather than mutating the old one or trusting the fix succeeded) means `manual` reflects what is actually still broken - including any fix that failed to take. The `#[non_exhaustive]` `FixAction` is handled with `if let`, so a future variant the daemon doesn't yet know how to apply is silently skipped rather than mis-handled.

The plain `orcker doctor` path is even simpler - it just renders `diagnose(&build_status_report(state))`. When the CLI can't reach the daemon at all, it never enters this crate; [orcker](../binaries/orcker) substitutes a synthetic `DiagnosisCode::DaemonDown` `Fail` so the down state still renders and exits non-zero.

## The checks, in emission order

`diagnose` pushes findings in a fixed sequence. The table lists each rule, its trigger, and the severity it emits.

| # | `DiagnosisCode` | Severity | Triggers when | Remedy / note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `PortFallback` | `Warn` | A *privileged* configured port (`requested < 1024`) fell back **and** `port_redirect != Some(true)` | `sudo orcker elevate ports` |
| 2 | `CaNotTrusted` | `Warn` | `ca.trusted_system == Some(false)` | `sudo orcker elevate trust` |
| 3 | `ResolverNotInstalled` | `Warn` | `resolver_installed == Some(false)` | `sudo orcker elevate resolver` |
| 4 | `NoPhpInstalled` | `Fail` | `php.is_empty()` | `orcker install php <default>` (suppresses #5) |
| 5 | `DefaultPhpNotInstalled` | `Fail` | `default_php` not among installed `php` | `orcker install php <default>` |
| 6 | `FpmPoolFailed` | `Fail` | one per pool with `state == Failed` | auto-fixed by `orcker doctor fix`, or `orcker use <ver>` |
| 7 | `ServiceFailed` | `Fail` | one per DB/cache service with `state == Failed` | `orcker service restart <svc>` |
| 7a | `ServiceOverrideInvalid` | `Warn` | one per bad line of a hand-edited `conf.d/50-local.<ext>` file; **not** auto-fixable | edit the file yourself, then `orcker service restart <svc>` |
| 8 | `PhpUpdateAvailable` | `Ok` | a pool has `update_available = Some(latest)` | `orcker update php <ver>` |
| 9 | `ResolverBackupSaved` | `Ok` | `resolver_backup == Some(path)` | informational, **no** remedy |
| 10 | `NoSites` | `Ok` | `sites.parked == 0 && sites.linked == 0` | `orcker park <dir>` / `orcker link <name> <dir>` |
| 11 | `DomainShadowed` | `Warn` | one per entry in `report.shadows` (a site whose apex or explicit domain was claimed by another site at router-build time); **not** auto-fixable | `orcker domain remove` / `orcker domain primary` |
| 12 | `BinDirNotOnPath` | `Warn` | `path_needs_setup == Some(true)` (a dev tool is installed but `{data}/bin` isn't on `PATH`) | `orcker path install` |
| 13 | `AllGood` | `Ok` | no `Warn`/`Fail` finding was produced | appended last |

A few rules carry subtle logic worth calling out.

### Privileged-port fallback (`PortFallback`)

```rust
const PRIVILEGED_PORT_CEILING: u16 = 1024;

fn privileged_fallback(report: &StatusReport) -> bool {
    (report.http.requested  < PRIVILEGED_PORT_CEILING && report.http.fell_back)
        || (report.https.requested < PRIVILEGED_PORT_CEILING && report.https.fell_back)
}
```

Only a port configured **below 1024** that fell back counts - a user who deliberately runs on `8080` and sees it bump to `8081` is not nagged. And even a genuine privileged fallback is suppressed when `report.port_redirect == Some(true)`: on macOS the daemon keeps binding the rootless ports after elevation, but an active pf `rdr` makes 80/443 reachable anyway, so the warning would be misleading. `Some(false)` (redirect present but inactive) and `None` (Linux / not applicable) both leave the warning in place. See [Elevation & Privileges](../../guide/elevation).

### "Unknown is silent" probes

`CaNotTrusted` and `ResolverNotInstalled` fire **only** on an explicit `Some(false)`. A `None` probe means "couldn't determine" - for example a CA store the daemon couldn't read - and produces no finding at all. This keeps the doctor from inventing problems out of missing data.

### PHP install findings are mutually exclusive

`NoPhpInstalled` (nothing installed) and `DefaultPhpNotInstalled` (the configured default specifically is missing) are wired as `if … else if …`, so an empty install only ever emits the broader `NoPhpInstalled`. See [PHP Versions](../../guide/php-versions).

### Informational findings never suppress `AllGood`

`PhpUpdateAvailable`, `ResolverBackupSaved`, and `NoSites` are all `Severity::Ok`. The `AllGood` summary is appended whenever no `Warn`/`Fail` exists - so a perfectly healthy machine that merely has an update available still shows the green "all checks passed" line alongside the informational ones.

### `ResolverBackupSaved` has no remedy on purpose

```rust
fn resolver_backup_finding(report: &StatusReport) -> Option<Diagnosis> {
    let path = report.resolver_backup.as_ref()?;
    Some(Diagnosis {
        code: DiagnosisCode::ResolverBackupSaved,
        severity: Severity::Ok,
        title: "Resolver file replaced".to_owned(),
        detail: format!(/* …saved to {path}… safe to delete, or copy it back… */),
        remedy: None,   // a path is not a runnable command
    })
}
```

The GUI renders `remedy` as a copy-the-command chip. The backup is a file *path*, not a command, so emitting it as a remedy would misrepresent it as runnable - hence `remedy: None`. The daemon only sets `resolver_backup` for a recent backup, so this finding auto-clears instead of nagging forever. See [DNS & .test Domains](../../guide/dns).

## Tests and invariants

The unit-test module builds a fully-healthy baseline `StatusReport` (`fn healthy()`) and perturbs single fields, asserting on the resulting `DiagnosisCode` set. The cases pin the rules above:

| Test | Invariant it locks in |
| --- | --- |
| `healthy_report_is_all_good_only` | a healthy report yields exactly `[AllGood]`, and `plan_auto_fixes` is empty |
| `privileged_fallback_warns_but_high_ports_do_not` | only sub-1024 requested ports warn on fallback |
| `active_port_redirect_suppresses_fallback_warning` | `Some(true)` suppresses; `Some(false)`/`None` do not |
| `ca_and_resolver_unknown_is_silent` | `None` probes emit nothing |
| `ca_and_resolver_false_warns` | `Some(false)` probes warn |
| `no_php_suppresses_default_not_installed` | empty install → only `NoPhpInstalled` |
| `default_not_installed_when_other_versions_present` | other versions installed but default missing → `DefaultPhpNotInstalled` |
| `failed_pool_is_fail_and_auto_fixable` | failed pool ⇒ `FpmPoolFailed` Fail, planned `RestartFpm(version)`, and `is_auto_fixable` agrees |
| `update_available_is_informational_and_still_all_good` | `Ok` findings coexist with `AllGood` |
| `resolver_backup_surfaces_as_ok_finding_with_no_remedy` | backup is `Ok`, `remedy.is_none()`, not auto-fixable |
| `no_sites_is_informational` | empty parked+linked ⇒ `NoSites` |
| `problems_suppress_all_good` | any `Warn`/`Fail` removes `AllGood` |

::: tip Adding a new check
Add the `Severity::Ok/Warn/Fail` finding in `diagnose` (use the `warn`/`fail` helpers), give it a new `DiagnosisCode` variant in `orcker-ipc` (additive - `DiagnosisCode` is `#[non_exhaustive]`), and pin it with a test off the `healthy()` baseline. If it should be auto-repairable, add a `FixAction` variant, emit it from `plan_auto_fixes`, list its code in `is_auto_fixable`, and teach the daemon's `run_doctor_fix` how to apply it.
:::

::: warning Keep `plan_auto_fixes` and `is_auto_fixable` in sync
`is_auto_fixable` is what the daemon uses to drop already-handled findings from the manual remainder. If a `FixAction` is added without updating `is_auto_fixable`, the daemon will both fix the problem *and* report it as still-manual.
