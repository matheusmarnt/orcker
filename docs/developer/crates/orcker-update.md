# orcker-update

`orcker-update` is the **decision layer** behind Orcker's self-update: given the
running version and a set of fetched GitHub releases, it decides whether a
newer version is available on the configured channel, and which downloadable
artifact matches the host platform. It powers the bare `orcker update` command
(see [Self-Update](../../reference/cli/update)) and the GUI's Updates section.

The crate does **no I/O**: fetching releases from GitHub, downloading
artifacts, and installing them all live in [`orckerd`](../binaries/orckerd) (the
version check) and [`orcker`](../binaries/orcker) (the applier, via
[`orcker-service-ctl`](./orcker-service-ctl)). This crate only decides *what*
should happen, given data the I/O layer already fetched.

::: info Crate metadata
`description`: *Pure release-channel selection and version-decision logic for
Orcker self-update.* `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. No internal `orcker-*`
dependencies - only `semver`, `sha2`, `hex`, and `minisign-verify`. A `pacman`
feature (off by default) flips [`PkgFormat::current`] from `Deb` to `Pacman`
for the Arch package build; `bin/orckerd`'s own `pacman` feature forwards into
it (`orcker-update/pacman`).

## Channel resolution: stable vs. edge

`select_target` takes the full set of fetched releases, the configured
[`Channel`], and the running version, and returns an [`UpdateDecision`]:

- **`Channel::Stable`** resolves to the highest version among releases that
  are *not* pre-releases.
- **`Channel::Edge`** resolves to the highest version across every release,
  pre-releases included.
- A release counts as a pre-release if either the source (GitHub) flagged it,
  **or** its semver carries a pre-release component (`-rc.N`) - so a
  mis-flagged release is still classified safely.
- The channel's latest only becomes `target` when it is strictly newer than
  `current`; otherwise `target` is `None` ("nothing to do"). This means the
  stable channel never *downgrades* a user running a newer pre-release -
  `UpdateDecision::ahead_of_stable` flags exactly that case, which drives the
  `--stable`/`--force` downgrade guard in the CLI.

`is_check_due` decides whether enough wall-clock time has passed
(`CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS`, 4 hours) since the last check to poll again; `orckerd`
uses it to gate its periodic background poll.

## Artifact selection and verification

`select_asset` picks the right downloadable artifact (plus its detached
signature and the `SHA256SUMS` manifest) out of a release's assets, by
filename convention: the macOS artifact ends `.app.tar.gz`, the Linux artifact
ends `.deb` or `.pkg.tar.zst` depending on [`PkgFormat`]. Intel macOS and any
other [`Platform::Unsupported`] host get `AssetError::NoArtifactForPlatform`
rather than a mis-selected file.

The detached signature is named `<artifact>.minisig` (minisign's own default),
with a legacy `<artifact>.sig` accepted as a fallback for releases published
before the rename. When both names are present `select_asset` prefers
`.minisig`, so behaviour is identical during and after the transition window;
if neither is attached the artifact is treated as unsigned and
`AssetError::MissingSignature` is returned. The rename exists because pacman
reserves `<pkg>.sig` for a detached OpenPGP signature, so publishing a minisign
`.sig` beside the Arch package broke `pacman -U` (#157).

Verification is two independent checks, both pure functions over
already-downloaded bytes:

- `verify_sha256` looks up the artifact's filename in the `SHA256SUMS` body
  and compares against a freshly computed digest.
- `verify_minisign` checks a detached, **prehashed** minisign signature
  against one of two embedded public keys - [`UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY`] for app
  artifacts, and the separate [`PHP_LISTING_PUBLIC_KEY`] for the PHP listing
  manifest fetched by `orcker-php` (a distinct key, since PHP installs are on
  the install critical path, not just app updates).

`orckerd`'s `StageUpdate` handler runs both checks before writing the artifact
to disk; the applier ([`orcker`](../binaries/orcker)) re-runs the minisign check a
second time immediately before swapping, closing the TOCTOU window between
daemon-verify and install.
