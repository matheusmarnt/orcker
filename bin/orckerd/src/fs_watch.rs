//! Filesystem watcher: keeps the live router fresh as projects appear or change.
//!
//! Detection runs at scan time (startup + every mutation), but a project cloned
//! into a parked folder *after* the last scan would otherwise serve from the
//! wrong directory until the next mutation or restart. This task watches the
//! relevant directories and rebuilds the router on change.
//!
//! ## What we watch (and what we don't)
//!
//! Watches are **non-recursive**, so the descriptor count scales with the number
//! of sites - not project size - and `vendor/`/`node_modules/` churn never
//! reaches a parent watch. The set is:
//! - every **parked root** (to notice child sites appearing/disappearing), plus
//! - the project root of every **unresolved** parked site (web root not detected
//!   yet) - so a project cloned in is picked up.
//!
//! A site is dropped from the watch set once it resolves (a framework/web root
//! was found) or is manually overridden - "don't watch what we already know".
//! The trade-off: deleting a resolved site's web root in place is not noticed
//! until the next scan from another trigger (a mutation, a sibling change, or a
//! restart).
//!
//! ## Wake sources
//!
//! - A debounced batch of filesystem events (project changed on disk).
//! - [`DaemonState::watch_dirty`], pinged after a mutation commits, so a freshly
//!   parked root is watched without waiting for an unrelated fs event.
//!
//! On either wake the task rebuilds the router from the *current* config under
//! the config lock (same lock order as the mutation path: config → router), so
//! it never races a concurrent mutation, and it **never writes config** - so it
//! cannot feed back into its own fs events.
