/**
 * Orcker's one-click WordPress admin login prepend script.
 *
 * Only ever loaded via a per-request `auto_prepend_file` PHP-FPM override
 * that orcker-proxy adds after validating a single-use login token - never
 * written into any site's own files, never reachable on an ordinary request
 * that legitimately carries the paired `ORCKER_LOGIN_USER` FastCGI param (see
 * the first guard below - required because `auto_prepend_file` itself can
 * outlive the request that set it on a reused PHP-FPM worker). If it does
 * run, it either logs the request in (as the site's configured admin, or
 * the earliest-created administrator if none was configured) and redirects
 * to wp-admin, or - if this site's own configured URL doesn't match the
 * host and scheme it's being served on - does nothing at all and lets the
 * original request continue completely normally.

// This file's own execution gate: `ORCKER_LOGIN_USER` is a plain FastCGI
// param (not a PHP ini setting), always sent by orcker-proxy on the one
// request that validated a token - but `auto_prepend_file` itself is a
// `PHP_INI_PERDIR` setting sent via the FastCGI `PHP_VALUE` mechanism, which
// PHP-FPM does not reliably reset between requests on a reused worker: a
// later request on the same worker can still have this file prepended even
// though orcker-proxy correctly stopped sending the override. Requiring
// `ORCKER_LOGIN_USER` to be *set* (not just checking `??`) is what actually
// gates this script's effect to genuinely-validated requests; without it,
// this was observed to auto-login and redirect on every subsequent
// `/wp-admin` hit on the same worker, producing an infinite redirect loop.
// Checked first, before anything else, so a leaked/stale invocation costs
// nothing beyond this one comparison.

// mismatch (e.g. a parked site whose siteurl is still http:// while orcker now
// serves it over https://) is just as unsafe to proceed on as a host
// mismatch: wp_set_auth_cookie()'s cookie flavour and admin_url()'s scheme
// both follow the *current* request, not the stored siteurl, so a mismatch
// here is exactly the kind of stale/incorrect configuration this guard
// exists to decline on rather than paper over.
