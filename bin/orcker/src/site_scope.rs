//! Resolving "which site am I in, and which PHP is pinned to it".
//!
//! Shared by the `wp` shim (which scopes WP-CLI to the site containing the
//! current directory) and `orcker exec` / `orcker which` (which run CLI PHP and
//! Composer under a site's pinned version). Both ask the daemon for the live
//! site list over a short-timeout `Request::ListSites` and match the current
//! directory against the sites' document roots.
//!
//! Two entry points, with deliberately different failure behaviour:
//!
//! - [`site_scope`] resolves by current directory. Outside any site - or if the
//!   daemon is unreachable or slow - it returns [`ScopeResolution::NoScope`] so
//!   callers fall back to the global default PHP. The two are not the same
//!   thing, though, so `NoScope` carries which one happened: "couldn't ask the
//!   daemon" still falls back (the latency budget below leaves no alternative),
//!   but `orcker exec` / `orcker which` warn on stderr, because otherwise a busy
//!   daemon silently demotes a site to the global default - the exact mismatch
//!   they exist to prevent. The `wp` shim stays quiet, where scoping is a
//!   convenience rather than the point. A cwd that *is* inside a site
//!   whose pinned version isn't installed returns
//!   [`ScopeResolution::MatchedPhpMissing`] instead, so callers fail loudly
//!   rather than silently running under an unrelated default.
//! - [`site_scope_by_name`] resolves an explicitly named site and never falls
//!   back: an unknown name, an uninstalled pinned version, and an unreachable
//!   daemon are all errors. The user named a site, so quietly running something
//!   else would be wrong.
//!
//! Unix-only.
