//! `orcker mcp` - serve Orcker's tools to AI agents over MCP on stdio.
//!
//! The protocol itself lives in the pure `orcker-mcp` crate; this module is the
//! I/O edge. It reads newline-delimited JSON-RPC from stdin, hands each line to
//! [`orcker_mcp::Server`], forwards the resulting tool calls to the daemon over
//! the same IPC socket the rest of the CLI uses, and writes replies to stdout.
//!
//! **stdout carries the protocol and nothing else.** Every diagnostic goes to
//! stderr; a stray `println!` here would corrupt the stream and desynchronise
//! the client.
//!
//! Reads block, which is safe here and nowhere else: `orcker` runs a
//! current-thread tokio runtime driving exactly this one task (see
//! `bin/orcker/src/main.rs`), so a blocked read starves nothing. It does mean the
//! session is single-flight - while a daemon exchange is in progress the loop
//! cannot answer a `ping` - which is why every exchange is timeout-bounded and
//! why no tool maps to a long-running daemon operation (`create_site` and
//! `install_php` return a job id immediately and are polled).
//!
//! For the same reason the exchanger is `.await`ed, never `block_on`'d: a nested
//! `block_on` inside the runtime that is already driving this task panics.
