//! Pure diagnosis and fix-planning for `orcker doctor`.
//!
//! This crate is runtime-free and does no I/O: [`diagnose`] turns a
//! [`StatusReport`] into a list of [`Diagnosis`] findings, and
//! [`plan_auto_fixes`] returns the safe, unprivileged [`FixAction`]s the daemon
//! may apply automatically. The daemon performs the actual I/O (status assembly,
//! restarting pools) and re-runs [`diagnose`] afterwards to compute what still
//! needs manual attention.
//!
//! ## Why `plan_auto_fixes(&StatusReport)` and not `auto_fix(&Diagnosis)`
//!
//! A wire [`Diagnosis`] carries only strings, so it cannot hand back the typed
//! [`orcker_core::PhpVersion`] a [`FixAction::RestartFpm`] needs. Planning fixes
//! from the typed report instead keeps the action list precise.
