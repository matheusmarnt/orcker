//! Error types for `orcker-php`.
//!
//! [`PhpError`] is **not** `Clone + Eq` because it wraps `std::io::Error` and
//! `orcker_platform::PlatformError`. This mirrors `orcker-config::ConfigError`'s
//! shape. The daemon is the only consumer; if a GUI surface ever needs a
//! `Clone + Eq` shadow, add one then.
