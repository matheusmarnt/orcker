//! Model Context Protocol (MCP) server logic for Orcker: the tool catalog, the
//! JSON-RPC state machine, and tool-result rendering.
//!
//! **Layer:** pure. This crate does no I/O, spawns nothing, reads no clock or
//! environment, and pulls in no async runtime. It is a *sans-io* state machine:
//! feed it one newline-delimited JSON-RPC message at a time with
//! [`Server::handle_line`] and it returns an [`Outgoing`] describing what the
//! caller should do. The stdio loop and the daemon exchange live at the binary
//! edge in `bin/orcker` (`orcker mcp`).
//!
//! Every tool maps to exactly one [`orcker_ipc::Request`], so a tool call needs at
//! most one daemon round trip: [`Outgoing::CallDaemon`] hands the caller a
//! [`PendingCall`], and [`PendingCall::complete`] turns the daemon's answer back
//! into the JSON-RPC reply line.
//!
//! # Gating
//!
//! Serving tools is opt-in (`mcp_enabled` in the config, toggled from the GUI).
//! The gate is a *UX* control, not a security boundary: any process running as
//! the user can already open the daemon's IPC socket. Handshakes therefore
//! always succeed - a disabled server that failed `initialize` would be
//! indistinguishable from a broken one in an agent's server list. Instead the
//! availability shows up in `initialize`'s `instructions` and, per call, as an
//! [`Outgoing::PolicyBlocked`] the caller answers with [`Server::gate_reply`].
