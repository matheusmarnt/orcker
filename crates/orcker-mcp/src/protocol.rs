//! JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope handling and MCP method dispatch.
//!
//! Two rules drive everything here and are easy to get wrong:
//!
//! - **Notifications are never answered.** A message without an `id` is a
//!   notification; unknown ones are ignored rather than erroring, or the server
//!   would emit a reply to a message that has nothing to reply to. A message
//!   without a `method` is a stray *response* and is likewise ignored.
//! - **`-32xxx` is for protocol faults, not policy.** A disabled toggle or an
//!   unreachable daemon is reported as a failed *tool result*, so the handshake
//!   still succeeds and the server does not look broken to the user.
//!
//! `initialize` and `ping` are answerable at any time (the spec allows a
//! pre-handshake ping); only `tools/list` and `tools/call` require that
//! `initialize` has been answered. The `notifications/initialized` message is
//! informational: it gates *server-initiated* requests, of which this server
//! has none, so a client that calls `tools/list` immediately after the
//! `initialize` result still works.

/// - No `method` **and** a `result` or `error`: a stray *response*. Ignored -
///   this server sends no requests, so it should not receive responses, and
///   answering one would be a violation.
/// - No `method`, no `result`/`error`: junk with nothing to dispatch on. If it
///   carries an `id` the sender is waiting, so it gets `-32600` rather than
///   silence.
/// - A `method` that is not a string: a malformed *request*, not a
///   notification. Same rule - `id` present means someone is waiting.
/// - A string `method` and no `id`: a notification. The only one this server
///   understands (`notifications/initialized`) is informational, and answering
///   an unknown one would itself be a violation, so all are consumed silently.
///
/// The subtlety is that "no usable method" must not be mistaken for "is a
