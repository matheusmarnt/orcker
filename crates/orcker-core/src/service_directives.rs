//! Pure validation for free-form service configuration overrides.
//!
//! Orcker regenerates each config-backed service's own config file on every
//! start, so a hand edit there is clobbered. Instead, users set overrides that
//! Orcker renders into a sidecar file (`conf.d/10-orcker.<ext>`) the engine
//! includes after Orcker's own settings. These are not typed: Orcker cannot know
//! the grammar of every directive of every engine, so a valid-shaped but
//! nonsensical entry is the engine's problem, not Orcker's. What this module does
//! guarantee is that an override can never corrupt a generated config file:
//! [`validate_name`] and [`validate_value`] are the **injection boundary**, run
//! when an override is set (CLI + daemon), when the config is loaded from disk
//! (`orcker-config`, leniently: bad entries are dropped), and again defensively
//! at render time ([`render_managed`]).
//!
//! Every engine spells its option file differently, so the shape rules,
//! rendering, and denylist are keyed by [`OverrideDialect`]; [`dialect_for`]
//! maps a service type id onto one, and is the single source of truth for
//! "does this service accept overrides at all".
//!
//! A per-dialect denylist ([`reserved`]) keeps overrides from colliding with
//! the directives Orcker manages through typed paths (the port, the data
//! directory, the socket, logging, the bootstrap init file, and the
//! loopback-only binding).
//!
//! This module is pure: string validation and rendering only, hand-rolled
//! (no `regex` dependency), mirroring [`crate::php_directives`].
