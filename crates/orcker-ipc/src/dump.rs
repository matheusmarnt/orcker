//! Dump-telemetry data model shared between the daemon, the GUI, and
//! (indirectly) the `orcker-php-ext` extension.
//!
//! The extension ships per-request telemetry frames to the daemon's
//! loopback dump server; the daemon buffers them as [`DumpEvent`]s and
//! serves them to the GUI over IPC. The daemon deliberately treats each
//! event's [`DumpEvent::payload`] as an **opaque** JSON value: it never
//! interprets the category-specific fields, so the extension's payload
//! schema can evolve without daemon changes. The GUI renders the payload
//! per [`DumpCategory`].
//!
//! Wire shapes are pinned in `tests/wire_stability.rs`.
