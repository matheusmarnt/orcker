//! The service *types* Orcker can manage, expressed as classes behind the
//! [`ServiceDefinition`] trait, plus the [`ServiceRegistry`] that owns them.
//!
//! Pure: no I/O. A `ServiceDefinition` is the compile-time identity and
//! behaviour of one kind of service (its id, default port, server binary, how
//! its datadir is initialised, how its server command is built, how it is
//! stopped, how readiness is probed). The supervisor and daemon read these facts
//! and drive them; the manager keys running instances by their *wire id* string,
//! so a single-instance engine (`"redis"`) and a per-site instance
//! (`"reverb:blog"`) share one code path.
//!
//! The "Redis" slot is served by **Valkey** (the BSD-licensed fork) - Redis 7.4+
//! is SSPL/RSALv2 and not cleanly redistributable. It stays wire-compatible so
//! clients are unaffected.
