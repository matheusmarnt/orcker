#
# Remove any /usr/bin symlinks postinst created — but ONLY on real removal, never
# on upgrade (the new package's postinst recreates them). In the normal layout
# Tauri ships the real binaries in /usr/bin (dpkg removes those itself); postinst
# only creates symlinks in the /usr/lib fallback path. dpkg does not track
# maintainer-script-created symlinks, so this is the only cleanup. We remove a
# symlink only if it still points into the /usr/lib fallback dir (the exact target
# shape postinst creates) - so real dpkg-owned files and foreign symlinks another
# package repointed are left alone, mirroring postinst's refuse-to-clobber guard.
