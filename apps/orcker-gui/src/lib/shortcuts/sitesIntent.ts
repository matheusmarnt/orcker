/**
 * A one-shot request to open a Sites-page dialog from elsewhere (the command
 * palette, a shortcut, or the system-tray "New Laravel site…" item). The
 * Link/Park/Create commands set this, then navigate to `/sites`; SitesView
 * consumes and clears it on mount (or while already mounted).
 *
 * Module-level singleton, like `useViewActions` - and per-webview, so the
 * standalone dumps/mails windows hold their own (always-null) copy.
