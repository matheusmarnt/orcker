 * Per-view contextual handlers for the shortcuts whose target depends on the

 * cycle. A view registers its handlers during setup and clears them via the
 * returned disposer on unmount; the dispatcher reads the live set when a chord
 * fires.
 *
 * `register` returns a disposer that clears state only if its registration is
 * still the active one (tracked by a per-call token), so a stale disposer from
 * an unmounting view can't wipe a newer view's registration.
