/**
 * Shared "start the daemon, wait for it to actually connect, and diagnose on

 * all surface the same diagnostics instead of a blind 20 s toast.
 *
 * Module-level **singleton** (like `useDaemon` / `useToast`): the phase, the
 * readiness-poll timer, and the diagnostics live here, not in component setup, so
 * a start kicked off on one screen keeps running and stays visible after the user
 * navigates away (previously the per-instance state was lost on unmount and the
 * Start button reappeared). The active start is mirrored into `useOperations` so
 * the global indicator shows "Starting Orcker…" from anywhere.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: it owns only the phase / timeout / fast-poll / diagnose
 * state. It does NOT own macOS login-item orchestration - that ordering is
 * load-bearing in onboarding (enable the GUI login item, *then* re-probe
 * approval) and must NOT run from the hero's "Start Orcker" button. Callers inject
 * that via the `beforeProbe` hook, which runs after `startDaemon` and returns
 * whether the daemon/GUI is now pending Login-Items approval.
 *
 * Phased button: "starting the daemon" may install / upgrade / start it before
 * the readiness wait. The Rust host emits a `daemon-start-phase` event as it
 * walks those steps; we reflect it in `phase`, which drives a step label on the
 * button ("Installing Daemon" -> "Starting Daemon" -> "Running Daemon"), resetting
 * to idle on completion. The frontend owns the `running` (readiness wait) and
 * `idle` phases; Rust owns the earlier ones.
